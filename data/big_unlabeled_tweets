1521234728745021441|@AlisaValdesRod1 I know it's a contentious issue, but have you tried human-grade ivermectin?  I have heard both ways on taking it.
1521235656038653955|@DaPearl1978 @annaworonko79 The virus has not been isolated. PCR tests are BS. You get feverish, SOB from the BIO-WEAPON, go to hospital, test positive with BS PCR. Sent to ICU, put on Remdisiver, kidneys shut down, lungs fill with fluid, your vented and die. Ivermectin/HCQ save lives.

What remuneration have you received for 1. Promoting covid vaccines, and 2. Attacking and harassing with falsehoods the physicians who worked not to kill under the Remdesivir protocol?  I hope they sue you for libel.

1521236168389664769|@mirai_aus Unjabbed. I got the coof last month and it was torment and agony for five days... waiting for any symptoms to emerge. None did. A total nothingburger. Wonder if my high dose vitamin D regime and ivermectin kit had anything to do with that?
