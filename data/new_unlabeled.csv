1520382880706355200|@RepMeijer @WHCOS No offense Mr. Representative. But, how are you worried about this? You were silent for 2 years while the CDC and other Government agencies lied to the world about Covid. Natural Immunity, Age stratified risk, Ivermectin cocktail, masks, ect.   Why speak up now?
1520383553644679168|@phweber1 @drsimonegold @elonmusk I was given ivermectin in 1976 for schistosomiasis/bilharzia (üá™üáπ-born Canadian üá®üá¶) and it worked! and long before it was given to animals. It was invented for humans! (P.S. .. she's not your honey, so don't be condescending in replies). #FactsMatter
1520382976030351362|This guy is so fucking dangerous. Tweeting shit like this with as large of a platform he has makes healthcare providers jobs harder. No different than with Trump and Ivermectin and then providers were overloaded with patients demanding it. https://t.co/EjxMME8Lxf
1520382997232590849|@Horsewithnona11 To clarify, Fauci does not make recommendations for drug dosing regimens. That is the FDA's remit. In non-hospitalized patients, remdesivir should start within 7 days of symptom onset.
1520383548850642944|@gcsurf123 @LauraWi82813817 @PaulDerrington @KatTimpf Pretty sure he is talking about himself. Basically liberals are way too lazy to do research and if there are contradictions too stupid to do any evaluation. There were over 70 thousand doctors saying ivermectin was working. I think you underestimate the greed of big pharma.

1520383073321467904|@MerissaHansen17 It needs to be!  As a monthly supplement, take just ONE 12 mg pill every 30 days and you won‚Äôt take have to take Advil ever again.    Patients with MS pain‚Ä¶.change your life.   It is the most powerful anti inflammatory I‚Äôve had, without the downside.   #ivermectin
