1520387029925863425|@PhillyPharmaBoy Why would anyone pick a drug that has a 53% death rate as Remdesivir did? This was not for the patient‚Äôs benefit.
1520386769358770176|@Jo86485902 @phweber1 @drsimonegold @elonmusk Yes, if you're pushing Ivermectin over Vaccine, that is dangerously ignorant  The two links are not pertinent to the issue
1520386990008586240|@FrontlineFlash @drsimonegold @elonmusk @Twitter Yes but please let ppl know that HCQ can increase the QRS wave as well as azithromycin so those with heart rhythm problems shouldn't take this medication. However doxycycline &amp; ivermectin can be used instead. Also doxycycline can become toxic after its expiration date.

1520386250439602177|@rionhaber @PaulDerrington @gcsurf123 @KatTimpf I‚Äôm aware of that but I was in Florida during Covid and I lived a completely different reality than ppl here. No lockdowns, masks or social distancing ever and when ppl did get Covid, very few, they used Ivermectin and were fine.

1520386236489293825|@DonnaSoucy @NHSenateDems Ivermectin is a human medicine. I would never dream of voting for someone who likes to pretend that it isn't. Why is this quack spreading medical disinformation? I hope Bidens new misinformation board shuts this guy down asap
1520384489142239232|@PhillyPharmaBoy It is my understanding that Fauci did choose Regeneron and Remdesivir. REM is a hospital treatment and most do not get hospitalized until they are way past 7 days. It is being pushed relentlessly when there is no chance of it helping. Hospitals get big reimbursements.
1520384953246269446|@iainAclark @RowdyKate2 @drdavidsamadi Paxlovid and molnupiravir work for COVID. Ivermectin does NOT work for COVID, and it can have toxicity. No one recommends it: not WHO, CDC, NIH, FDA, EU, any physician societies...just a few confused docs who don't understand properly controlled trials https://t.co/ffaZUQUhc3
1520387385179136000|@MerissaHansen17 Because Bill Gates is now putting his hat in the ring with ivermectin so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not the same anymore
1520385307153158144|@Nicholas9794255 It's funny how it went from "you righties want to use horse wormer" to "it is used in humans, but..."  next it will be their idea to use ivermectin.  In the case of the 2020 vote, keep at it...they'll think it was their idea to declare voter fraud.
1520385733625892864|@tedlieu You‚Äôre either galatically stupid or evil. Maybe both. Ivermectin won the creators a Nobel Prize because IT WORKS.
1520383073321467904|@MerissaHansen17 It needs to be!  As a monthly supplement, take just ONE 12 mg pill every 30 days and you won‚Äôt take have to take Advil ever again.    Patients with MS pain‚Ä¶.change your life.   It is the most powerful anti inflammatory I‚Äôve had, without the downside.   #ivermectin
1520382880706355200|@RepMeijer @WHCOS No offense Mr. Representative. But, how are you worried about this? You were silent for 2 years while the CDC and other Government agencies lied to the world about Covid. Natural Immunity, Age stratified risk, Ivermectin cocktail, masks, ect.   Why speak up now?
1520382976030351362|This guy is so fucking dangerous. Tweeting shit like this with as large of a platform he has makes healthcare providers jobs harder. No different than with Trump and Ivermectin and then providers were overloaded with patients demanding it. https://t.co/EjxMME8Lxf
1520386357344051201|@EricTopol @DrPanMD Ivermectin works.   And it‚Äôs pennies on the dollar compared to other treatments.
1520384420699594753|@reedgalen @missjst Yet, FAR fewer dems died from Covid the the Ivermectin, fk masks party.
1520385237968203776|Maybe because @tedlieu says Ivermectin isn‚Äôt anymore effective than Snickers? https://t.co/uoMQ4DgE70

The person was desperate things were going bad - took ivermectin and there was a strong turnaround which the (highly educated) patient says was very strongly correlated. At the end of the day we have vaccine now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
