1520387214923993090|@drsimonegold @elonmusk @JohnStrangerUSA Dr Zelenko is another HUGE HERO in my book!!Dr Malone, Dr MuCulough, Dr Carrie Madj, &amp; so many more. Hospitals or health‚Äùcare‚Äù worker who refused to treat early with Hydroxy, or Ivermectin, killed the patient &amp; should be treated as murderers. The facts were there for all to see.
1520387385179136000|@MerissaHansen17 Because Bill Gates is now putting his hat in the ring with ivermectin so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not the same anymore

1520387006299533312|@rionhaber @PaulDerrington @gcsurf123 @KatTimpf No actual debate -I have no idea of the politics of this. The person was desperate things were going bad - took ivermectin and there was a strong turnaround which the (highly educated) patient says was very strongly correlated. At the end of the day we have vaccine now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
1520386990008586240|@FrontlineFlash @drsimonegold @elonmusk @Twitter Yes but please let ppl know that HCQ can increase the QRS wave as well as azithromycin so those with heart rhythm problems shouldn't take this medication. However doxycycline &amp; ivermectin can be used instead. Also doxycycline can become toxic after its expiration date.
1520387181533175809|This reminds me of when Trump recommended  hydroxychloroquine, as a treatment for Covid 19. It didn't work, did it? https://t.co/RxEZZvzd7n
1520387029925863425|@PhillyPharmaBoy Why would anyone pick a drug that has a 53% death rate as Remdesivir did? This was not for the patient‚Äôs benefit.

1520386250439602177|@rionhaber @PaulDerrington @gcsurf123 @KatTimpf I‚Äôm aware of that but I was in Florida during Covid and I lived a completely different reality than ppl here. No lockdowns, masks or social distancing ever and when ppl did get Covid, very few, they used Ivermectin and were fine.
1520386357344051201|@EricTopol @DrPanMD Ivermectin works.   And it‚Äôs pennies on the dollar compared to other treatments.

1520386769358770176|@Jo86485902 @phweber1 @drsimonegold @elonmusk Yes, if you're pushing Ivermectin over Vaccine, that is dangerously ignorant  The two links are not pertinent to the issue
1520385733625892864|@tedlieu You‚Äôre either galatically stupid or evil. Maybe both. Ivermectin won the creators a Nobel Prize because IT WORKS.

1520386236489293825|@DonnaSoucy @NHSenateDems Ivermectin is a human medicine. I would never dream of voting for someone who likes to pretend that it isn't. Why is this quack spreading medical disinformation? I hope Bidens new misinformation board shuts this guy down asap
1520386211239583745|@Dirtnappp @n8tvch1k @_RoughCountry @tsn_says I provide vaccinations also. We support medical freedom. The problem is people are too polarized. Vaccinations &amp; Remdosivir vs. supplements and ivermectin. I respect all patients wishes. I‚Äôve treated COVID in unvax, vax and vax injuries
