@ottobound Sending prayers. Ivermectin kills cancer.
@hiebinator @MeghanMcCain They believe that because it’s true. Did you know ivermectin was given to Afghanistan refugees before coming to America? Of course not. Who cares about truth when you’re a lefty.
@DaveLovesGolf you can easily buy ivermectin from our site. Visit:- https://t.co/hM2oQGDa5A
@tylerblack32 @elonmusk @pmarca Not to mention the “doctors” told us early covid treatment of HCQ and IVM were useless. That the only treatment is Remdesivir for inpatients. LIES LIES AND MORE LIES.
@NePlus4aiv Don't apologize 🤣. On the three points. 1. Ivermectin does have a use as a horse dewormer,amongst other things. No peer reviewed trials have shown any help at all in treating covid. My concern therefore is people taking it without doctor involvement
FDA renews 'horse' smear as ivermectin trends on new Twitter https://t.co/lx75VscLga
The only thing more deadly about covid in comparison to regular flu is the treatment! #remdesivir #arrestfauci
@BadLegalTakes If this were true a bunch of people would have gone to jail for promoting ivermectin. I really wish there were some legal measures in place to discourage non professionals from making medical/health claims they are not qualified to speak on.
@SmashYourTV @AmberFaire1 Lmao this buffoon quoting the data from corrupt governments of the world. Explain why countries with very low "vaccination" rate and who use ivermectin and HCQ like it's candy had the lowest case rates and lowest death rates in the world. I'll wait.

@helenparker123 The NHS are pure evil, they are knowingly inflicting psychological pain on the public based on illogical science. If not mental anguish they are pumping patients with drugs that are dangerous based on the fraudulent positive PCR test. Remdesivir kills !!!
@chedca @HealthySaneBE @matt_quantum @cappuccino64 Because you are using it to try and change the subject. It has zero relevance to your initial statement that remdesivir is killing people.  And because it is a webpage, not a study. It is neither systematic, nor does it follow standards for meta analysis.

@RemmyRobertson @MerissaHansen17 Unvaxxed 95 year old grandmother had covid, started going downhill on doctor's recommendations, friend slipped her a 3 day supply of ivermectin and she's well. Nothing compares to real experience

@peterlatroab @BeckyJohnson444 @Jasper33430720 @maz314Wa Ivermectin might be the greatest thing since sliced bread, I honestly have no idea.  Your “study” used cherry picked data for a meta analysis performed by employees of a company that profits from selling the product they are promoting.    It’s not a study - it’s an advertisement.
@PragDreamer @champagne_witch @MerissaHansen17 The very FIRST study listed on that page says:  the Panel recommends against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19, except in a clinical trial
@SpudLakeCapital @landlPM @HedyFry @JustinTrudeau Yes from taking ivermectin
@MerissaHansen17 Money. Ivermectin is cheap and the money is in vaccines.   It would be so easy to make IVM available.
@rickdiculous23 @MeghanMcCain Funny how the “deworming” Ivermectin was given to thousands of Afghanistan refugees before coming here. But hey, I admire your commitment to stupidity.
Just 3000 trial participants and US government agrees to buy over $5 billion dollars of Pfizer’s Paxlovid pills meanwhile we have millions of people who successfully used ivermectin to treat cov19 which costs pennies.  Follow the corrupt money.
@Jc409John @robertsgm @michaeljknowles I mean unless you’re going to tell me that horses shop at that pharmacy, they did prove that ivermectin is being used by humans. So OP is wrong.

@PBGuy71 @JamesMelville Couldn't agree LESS.  Ivermectin and HCQ and Chlorine Dioxide &amp; others would have prevented much of the damage.....the 'vaccines' did NOTHING but harm.
@creative_amanda @Wolfiesmom demokkkrats manufactured the Russia hoax, Ukraine hoax, smullett hoax lied about ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and now want to talk to us about ministry of truth. demokkkrats are the same people that say black people aren't smart enough to get a photo ID.
@callen727 @CBoyForeman @EnderLever @TheFreds @KirstieMAllsopp As long as they didn’t give him Remdesivir as well or he probably wouldn’t be alive now to type! That’s the hospital killer not Covid, of course they say it’s Covid but the organ damage is from the Remdesivir.  The fact they give that for Covid should make people question the jab
@hiebinator @MeghanMcCain Ivermectin was never proposed to cure the virus. Ivermectin and Quercetin are used to help the zinc get inside the cells to fight the virus.  Now who's spreading "disinformation"?

@jayr1972 @Frank_A_Quiller @Pompey Yes every western government, China, Russia but notably not India. They demanded to conduct their own trial of the Pfizer vaccine and Pfizer ran off.Why ? Ivermectin proved extremely effective in Uttar Pradesh and is now licensed for use in covid here !!!
@Horsewithnona11 To clarify, Fauci does not make recommendations for drug dosing regimens. That is the FDA's remit. In non-hospitalized patients, remdesivir should start within 7 days of symptom onset.
@quinky_dink @suzanneleavey If too many Drs. were to prescribe Ivermectin for Covid-19, it could mean that folks that use it for severe arthritic conditions may have to go without. Drug stores were low on it I guess at one point during the Pandemic.

@chedca @HealthySaneBE @matt_quantum @cappuccino64 Why have you changed the subject to a different argument? You are trying to prove remdesivir kills people. Your argument appears to be that the lack of significant mortality difference in ACT1 was due to differences between centres...in a RANDOMISED trial. https://t.co/ESUi3dnp4d
@mjkpa32 @AwakenWithJP It was also successfully used in India. Oh and why didn't Africa have a huge outbreak when most of the population is on ivermectin?
@KellyMo35360323 @BeenHavingIt66 @Carawieneke @MDinCanada It was premeditated murder in my opinion.  All these cases are. Take a look at the screen shots I sent in this thread.  Midazolam depresses the respiratory system, and so does Remdesivir. Why would they give someone in respiratory distress these drugs? It can’t be to save them.
@hiebinator @MeghanMcCain Did it kill the virus or battle the symptoms?  I would rather try ivermectin than take a " vaccine" that does not stop the targeted affliction. Seems to me that it is not much of an effective vax

@FrontlineFlash @drsimonegold @elonmusk @Twitter Yes but please let ppl know that HCQ can increase the QRS wave as well as azithromycin so those with heart rhythm problems shouldn't take this medication. However doxycycline &amp; ivermectin can be used instead. Also doxycycline can become toxic after its expiration date.
@JGademski The Labor bastardry was enacted at Fed level by the Libs. Do u need reminding that Ivermectin and HCQ was banned first by Fed "Health" bureaucrats and Morrison instituted the first lockdown and NEVER defended any ant lockdown protesters?
@benedictevans Again, there is a difference between content moderation and censorship. Content moderation for things that are illegal is just fine. Censorship of ideas is dystopian.  Couple of quick ones.  Ivermectin  Lab leak theory  Hunters laptop.  Vaccine side effects.  These are censorship
@pmarca Some drugs cause psychosis and inhibited reasoning (or pliability). Ivermectin, for instance can do that if taken without professional supervision and observation.  Just sayin'
@quinky_dink The company that makes ivermectin for humans, Merck, stated in Feb 2021 that there was "No scientific basis for a potential therapeutic effect against COVID-19 from pre-clinical studies" discovered up to that point. They went on to spend millions to develop a Covid treatment drug

@JamesLynchGTC @HealthySaneBE @matt_quantum @cappuccino64 yes, "an IFR or 0.57 is huge" but that was way outside the average. What accounted for difference in patient outcomes between locations that resulted in an IFR of 0.57 when the average was 0.04*? If Remdesivir is an inferior treatment, its use may be responsible for those deaths.

That is why it became standard treatment. As we have continued later trials showed little difference hence it is being used less.

@JamesLynchGTC @HealthySaneBE @matt_quantum @cappuccino64 if the average IFR was 0.04 on average why was it so much worse in some places? differences in SOC is undoubtedly a factor. Where it can be shown that there are more appropriate protocols available and the government insists on choosing Remdesivir, then that contributes to deaths

@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Speak for yourself. Some of aren't stupid enough to fall for crap. Ps. Ivermectin works and Russia is not your enemy. The people telling you they're your enemy are your real enemy. No need to thank me.
Ivermectin is a medication that helps us reduce symptoms of parasitic infections caused by rosacea, such as redness, swelling, and pimples. #ivermectinday #parasitic #skincare #rosacea #swelling #pimples https://t.co/H7b5LzBR6I
@PoliBard Ivermectin.
@slurpmynutts @rootslayer @PhillyPharmaBoy @MerissaHansen17 Ivermectin is an anti parasitic drug. Virus are tiny parasites according to the NIH. That’s why ivermectin is effective in treating Covid. Dr. Mengele Fauci has always known this.
@tanya_plibersek Are you going to take responsibility for all the deaths and destruction due to your Covid PLANdemic lies? Ivermectin works fine and is safe and effective. The toxic experimental drug you call vaccines not so much.  #crimeagainsthumanity #Nuremberg2
@PaulGrimshaw15 @itsjillgardner @ChrisKing_161 @JimCognito2016 Of course. Can you explains why the countries with the lowest Jab rates and poorest health care system's had far better outcomes. I'll give you a clue. They rejected the bioweapon and used safe and effective early treatments. Ivermectin HCQ. You've been played for a fool
@KathMLee1 @nypost Anti-virals as a prophylaxis for STI's that are RNA viruses 🤔...  Obviously ivermectin is a anti-parasitic vs 🦀, scabies, trichomoniasis, but also shows promise vs HiV?
@gcsurf123 @JoseMac110861 @KatTimpf That’s rich coming from the guy who thinks ivermectin is some kind of devil pill. It’s been used in billions of humans over several decades. It’s proven effective at fighting a virus that has the world in an uproar. Only the viewers of nothing but the MSM still don’t know that.
Well the ivermectin crowd is back out in full force on Twitter. Good times! I opened up a shit storm by informing people the largest supplier of ivermectin for human consumption in the US is Merck under the brand name Stromectol.

@EricTopol Vitamin D, Eric!  https://t.co/tUkOTSRg1W  The answer could be that simple, but unfortunately, it won't make Big Pharma rich, which is why you and other Big Pharma shills don't promote it.  The same accounts for Ivermectin, Melatonin etc. Shame!
@JamesLynchGTC @HealthySaneBE @matt_quantum @cappuccino64 Remdesivir is a repurposed drug. in'A Randomized, Controlled Trial of Ebola Virus Disease Therapeutics' authors show other drugs were more effective with 58% of participants in the Remdesivir group dying.

@MerissaHansen17 Because Bill Gates is now putting his hat in the ring with ivermectin so I’m sure it’s not the same anymore
@Nicholas9794255 It's funny how it went from "you righties want to use horse wormer" to "it is used in humans, but..."  next it will be their idea to use ivermectin.  In the case of the 2020 vote, keep at it...they'll think it was their idea to declare voter fraud.
@chedca @HealthySaneBE @matt_quantum @cappuccino64 And yes. I agree given what we now know about remdesivir outcomes it has little effect on outcome. That does not mean it kills.
@PghWildlife @quinky_dink Did you not hear that the Emergency Authorization paid big pharma a lot?   Ivermectin has been around for a very long time. It is way cheaper than the vaccines. The same way opioids are cheaper than current addiction meds.  Same scam, different medication. It's the patent!
@Fionalo53519376 @VictoryDay_Hope You're wrong, if you claim to know nothing about ivermectin - you've been living under a rock for some time now. Even the W.H.O. has claimed it "wonder drug" because it got an award..

@EricTopol @DrPanMD Ivermectin works.   And it’s pennies on the dollar compared to other treatments.

@RonFilipkowski No @JDVance1 #Trump tried to kill off #MAGA voters with anti vaxx and #Ivermectin
@hiebinator @MeghanMcCain Is it possible that there’s a parasitic aspect to Covid? That would explain the evidence that Ivermectin works. Nah, probably just ignore that obvious question.
@xtrixcyclex @tomwatson @ChrisInWaIes Huh you mean stuff like covid came from a wet market HydroxyQ is dangerous Ivermectin is for horses masks and lockdowns work Hunters laptop was Russian disinformation Russian collusion hoax Covington kids incited violence And on and on with the lies that have been debunked
@askforlinda @NSWHealth Ivermectin is the best solution.
@ElizabethClod13 @hiebinator @MeghanMcCain I’m 67 yrs old with heart issues.. took Ivermectin for Covid and was well in 3 days. I told my kids not to take me anywhere near a hospital or I would come back to haunt them. Remdisiver and CDC protocols are what’s deadly.
@AnnastaciaMP It’s not over. We still have a state of emergency. We still have medical apartheid. We still have second class citizens. We still have no jab no job. Our doctors still can’t treat us with ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. @qldhealth @yvettedath
@NePlus4aiv Absolutely second hand knowledge but my daughter is a doctor who worked with the drug trials for some that helped,others that didn't. Ivermectin not so much but hydroxy has caused serious problems where people have become sick and a number died

@kayleen87686977 @pebbles_splash They cooked the books.  The CDC is dodgy af.  First they recalibrated the numbers to reflect hospitalizations instead of cases.  Then they no longer count a Covid hospitalization unless the patient is on either remdesivir or dexamethasone. So there are plenty of people w Covid /1

@rickdiculous23 @MeghanMcCain You're still clueless about what ivermectin is and that it is used in humans on a very regular basis.  You really should not get your information from mainstream media.  Whether it works or not is irrelative, you sound ignorant.
@jeanthorpe @RepAndyBiggsAZ Ok. Why were there no excess mortality in 2020 but since the vaccine people are getting COVID like crazy and young people dropping like flies?  Fauci wrote a paper about ivermectin being treatment for coronavirus...you people need to stop falling for MSM propaganda.
@B53Lacey I have personally experienced from family who "heard something about a medication", and we have Ivermectin as an example on a larger scale, that people will take statements like that and fully buy into them, causing problems for themselves and others.
@JimDan0 @scrowder @elonmusk Well assuming you're a republican, it seems like a lot of you believe Great White Hope won the 2020 election. If you believe that, you'll believe fucking anything.

@leslibless The Remdesivir will kill the child and they will cite cause as Covid. Any doctor gives that poison out is committing murder.
@dietcheese @BretWeinstein Perhaps you have been living under a rock. This msm talking point has been proven false. Ivermectin works. Now run along.
“Ivermectin works” was never just an opinion, it was always a solid proven FACT. Other states will follow as the Mass Formation Psychosis subsides and people realise SarsCoV2 infection is treatable and curable. https://t.co/859uDKHgRT. https://t.co/zO0ENHJu5h https://t.co/VoLa2gb74B
@leslibless I pray parents don't allow their children to be given Remdesivir. It is a death sentence for anyone at any age.
@chedca @HealthySaneBE @matt_quantum @cappuccino64 That choice was made before this based on the trial I shared and that we were discussing. No. Remdesivir kills people if it kills people. But this trial, nor any RCT shows it kills people. No. Which of those shows significantly improved mortality?
@TravelEater @HedyFry @JustinTrudeau There's real evidence that Ivermectin has anti-cancer properties, but the mRNA injections are causing an increase in cancers due to the suppression of cancer- fighting gene P53. You're obviously misinformed.

@Khairykj @NIH @ICR_NIH @drkalai61 @Khairykj and @DGHisham are bought and paid for by Pfizer. No wonder they lie about the effectiveness of Ivermectin. No wonder the say there are no dangerous side effects from the mRNA shots.
@duhaggan @denise_dewald Wrong.... start taking Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine
@Jo86485902 @phweber1 @drsimonegold @elonmusk Yes, if you're pushing Ivermectin over Vaccine, that is dangerously ignorant  The two links are not pertinent to the issue
Midazolam and remdesivir (along with propofol or morphine) https://t.co/jrasMFWOZS
@MarhattaRosalyn @MungoJ3rry @WHCommsDir They were given Remdesivir and were wrongly put on ventilators.
@MerissaHansen17 Because this would hurt the EUA for the vaxes, remdesivir (sp?), etc.  In short, they'd make less money as there'd be less fear of the virus with an over 98% survival rate
@JamesLynchGTC @HealthySaneBE @matt_quantum @cappuccino64 Again for the third time, standards of care were different between hospitals and changed over time. What was the SOC outside of remdesivir anywhere anyways? Where I am there was no early outpatient treatment protocol authorized by government and testing was reserved for hospitals
@chedca @HealthySaneBE @matt_quantum @cappuccino64 That calculation from Ioannadis was made in October 2020. Using data from months before then. Befire remdesivir was used outside clinical trials.  How on Earth could it be responsible?

@Cindyofthesouth @FriskyCentipede @dashablue1 @MarshaBlackburn And this is the epitome of what is wrong with this country. The right never can produce evidence of anything they believe in.

@rdv4017 @DiamondandSilk I wonder how many people died because the dems and the media lied about the effectiveness of Ivermectin?
@nofeltweaver @Becstar89 Remdesivir? I think it was that one, yes.
@PhillyPharmaBoy It is my understanding that Fauci did choose Regeneron and Remdesivir. REM is a hospital treatment and most do not get hospitalized until they are way past 7 days. It is being pushed relentlessly when there is no chance of it helping. Hospitals get big reimbursements.
@jjchamie There have been a number of randomised controlled trials for ivermectin. Not one has shown any efficacy at any stage . You have quoted a non clinical source. I repeat a non clinical source. . I wish whatever drug stated did work but they do not. the ivermectin manufacturers agree
@glarriuz @SarahJ936 @jack You think it’s misinformation because they banned the doctors that spoke of the success they had with it.  The same doctors that criticized using Remdesivir because it leads to organ failure.
@HRCtakedown Well its certainly not about saving humanity, thats for sure. We all remember how they told us ivermectin didnt work when it actually do work. and with much much less adverse effects. The countries that used ivermectin have bettter statistics.

@John28500101 @KenDollGenitals @adam0sky @hiebinator @MeghanMcCain That's fine, you do you I will do me. If come down with covid, which I had and yes it went away after 2 months and didn't get worse. But if I were to get it again and I got to the point I can't breath, I will take the ivermectin!
@MerissaHansen17 I mean we all know why. Trump, Rohan endorsements. Dr.s lost their job, and credibility over Ivermectin.
@MerissaHansen17 It needs to be!  As a monthly supplement, take just ONE 12 mg pill every 30 days and you won’t take have to take Advil ever again.    Patients with MS pain….change your life.   It is the most powerful anti inflammatory I’ve had, without the downside.   #ivermectin

@CovidDataReport The vxd are more likely to seek "professional treatments" while the other group might choose early treatment that has for the most part produced stellar results. Remdesivir is not your friend, neither is T.F.

@phweber1 @drsimonegold @elonmusk This shows your ignorance of...well, everything.  Ivermectin was for humans and is still prescribed for humans.  Hey, I just had to give my dog some Amoxicillin does that mean when I am sick, I am taking "dog ass pills"?  Nope, made for humans first, tested on animals first.
@MaxAbrahms Yes can  MSM and the Dems who incited violence be banned.  Especially the HHS should be banned for pushing dangerous vax knowing of the dangers, but going for the $$$ anyway.  Still pushing drugs like dangerous Remdesivir on littkle kids.  .  How can this be?
@KarlHeinzSmith1 @BeckyJohnson444 @Jasper33430720 @maz314Wa I wonder about the motivations for those that pan ivermectin. It has been used for years as an antiparasitic worldwide.

@glarriuz @jack If those who died early on had been treated properly they likely wouldn’t have died. If not given drugs like midazilam or remdesivir, they might have survived. If given early treatment of Ivermectin, vits C &amp; D, etc, most would likely still be here.
@gcsurf123 @LauraWi82813817 @PaulDerrington @KatTimpf Pretty sure he is talking about himself.

@HudsonFarrell @jneill @neilstweet @Awithonelison @Tomaste9 @FreedomPodcast1 @badvaers @gnomepigface @SallyJiggles @IvorMectin1 @Ivor_Mectin56 @StevenWilson777 LOL and there's the ivermectin.  JFC. You lot and your failure to handle the basics.
@ottobound God bless you.  Take ivermectin supposed to help.
@antbee_xrp Ivermectin helped me and my family with Covid-19 doctor in Norway 🇳🇴 was like this is not good fore you.. you need the jabs 😂😂  Hey fuck the vaccine 💉 🤙🏻 #woke
Maybe because @tedlieu says Ivermectin isn’t anymore effective than Snickers? https://t.co/uoMQ4DgE70
@psychopoulos @realitychk2020 @JasonBailey @Sam41673265 @DanRather No...we should have treated people with the protocols that have worked from day 1 ~used by private practice doctors to actually cure people of Covd...rather than silencing those doctors and treatments and instead murdering them with Remdesivir and Ventilator
@DschlopesIsBack @ChrisRBarron @ZelenkoZev The FDA and CDC politicized the use of Hydroxychloroquine. That, along with politicizing by the democrats and MSM, is shameful and cost thousands of lives.  Hydroxychloroquine is a useful adjunct therapy for COVID!!!
two days after elon buys twitter and ivermectin and combination treatment, i.e. the zelenko protocol, Tyson and Fareed, the FLCCC, McCollough, so many others are not trending as they should be. instead it is what? shameful.  if there were a change it'd be from public health first
New Hampshire Senate Committee Passes No-Prescription-Ivermectin Legislation https://t.co/uuwgXeVKE3
@phweber1 @drsimonegold @elonmusk I myself know several people who took ivermectin along with zinc right away upon covid infection, and sailed through without issues. Meanwhile, I'm in healthcare and I have encountered all manner of adverse effects from the clot shots. Oh honey, how do you explain that?
@defiunicorn @jack Ivermectin and Pepcid work to treat COVID-19, but the US government and healthcare workers don't want people to have access to them.  So fucking false
@unhealthytruth She's known for yelling: "You get a car!" "You get a car!" "You get a car!" The world would love her if she yelled: "YOU GET IVERMECTIN!" "YOU GET IVERMECTIN!" "YOU GET IVERMECTIN!" "YOU GET IVERMECTIN!"
@elonmusk @pmarca Nonexperts giving medical advice should always be reported, especially when over 23000 people "like" such ridiculously uninformed positions. This is right up there with colloidal silver, bleach injection, ivermectin and snake oil.  Got another stock you're trying to manipulate?
@capetownrocks1 Ivermectin helps with cancer?
@maizrapaz @mgoomusic @Fionalo53519376 @VictoryDay_Hope Tested I thought I had plain flu 🤧 but then I actually 'took it with a pinch of salt" I used ivermectin for pigs and allergex  Just a bad cough too really
@doihavtasay We definitely have vastly different experiences. Mine was given antibodies and recovering then switched to remdesivir and that was it. Plus the ones that died of blood clots and heart issues didn’t have Covid.
@wfpalmer @coxkhc @Jim_Jordan Follow Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin. Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky. Senators Johnson has been working really hard to bring to Congress the damage done by the vax! The of people it has maimed and killed. The fact that Remdesivir killed more people than CV!
@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf How funny that you mention ivermectin in the context of “fighting misinformation” and people susceptible to it. You realize there was a huge misinformation campaign against that drug, right? Right? Your post highlights what a ludicrous idea it is to create a ministry of truth
@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Ivermectin every day all year long before ever getting the jab.  Had your fourth yet?
@elonmusk @pmarca A continuation of Trump's Ivermectin Triology guest authored by Elon. Third and final part by Dr Oz out this Fall, before an election near you.
Ivermectin works!
@rionhaber @PaulDerrington @gcsurf123 @KatTimpf No actual debate -I have no idea of the politics of this. The person was desperate things were going bad - took ivermectin and there was a strong turnaround which the (highly educated) patient says was very strongly correlated. At the end of the day we have vaccine now 🤷‍♀️
@AEiffel95 @20committee Ivermectin helped me when I had covid. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Where’s the lie.
@MerissaHansen17 Ivermectin does pay as much
Twitter appears to have temporarily suspended @TheTNStar for tweeting about a new law passed in Tennessee and signed by the governor that allows ivermectin to be sold over the counter.  https://t.co/MykumOcis5
@WSJ Sounds exactly like ivermectin, just sayin
@TimRunsHisMouth Ivermectin
@SCOOTERX1 @theworkshop36 @MerissaHansen17 This is disinformation. Ivermectin has been proven to reduce COVID symptoms.
@MdBreathe @Twitter If ivermectin was used to treat covid, there wouldn’t have be so many deaths.
@phweber1 Ivermectin is a medication for humans, too… it’s not horse paste. 🤦‍♀️ Are you for real?!
@DanRather BS . . . lies , our entire family has had it and never allowed anything injected into them . Ivermectin / hydrox . . . 👍 Thanks to the government we had to order from out of the country .   MY BODY , MY CHOICE, LEARNED THAT FROM A BABY KILLER!!!!!! https://t.co/O0wx9QUvbD
@elonmusk @pmarca And you are the medical expert?  There are simply too many antidepressants in the USA. Any comments on ivermectin, bleach, Plaquenil, Kaletra ?
@SusanLeeLaw @Guglar9 @lisa_iannattone Mine ignored my advice. They took ivermectin instead.
@TylerGr16741200 @GoblinKush420 @thebradfordfile Ivermectin is on the WHO list of essential medicines. They are not saying cure, but tons of “reliable” studies easily show outcomes are improved. AND virtually no side effects. WHY forbid doctors to treat them? Obviously EUA implications. Unreal.
@caroljsroth Annnd were ⚡️charged⚡️for some ivermectin and hcq...
@AConcernedPare2 Begin ivermectin treatment based on body weight. Continue for 4 to 5 days.
@US_FDA “WHO has issued a conditional recommendation against the use of Remdesivir in hospitalized patients, regardless of disease severity, as there is currently no evidence that Remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes in these patients.” World Health Organization
@georgeanno @GoblinKush420 @thebradfordfile The most likely theory is that the ivermectin is actually working against any parasitical infection people may have, which is making the people stronger to fight COVID. More studies are needed, but the primary center, South Africa, also ran a massive public health campaign.

@inc0gnitotweet0 @MixxDeb It is my understanding that Ivermectin and Wellbutrin are completely different drugs?
@WilliamDamon @jack @MrAndyNgo They can not talk about Ivermectin (I'm a Pharmacist and twitter would ban me).  You can not discuss how the election was stolen, unless you are talking about 2016.  You can not discuss how wrong mask mandates were. Shall I go on?

@SmoothUpinya77 @brianschatz @All100Senators If you don’t know, you better ask somebody. trump’s supporters are falling 1x1, not counting ~845K trump’s base supporters that died unnecessarily from COVID due to conspiracy crack theories like Clorox &amp; hydroxychloroquine (see Dr Birx’s comments) 1653 allies/lawyers have fallen
@SCOOTERX1 @theworkshop36 @MerissaHansen17 Ron, you should maybe let your dog teach you. Ivermectin generic is pennies per dose.  Merck proprietary version costs whatever they want it to... fool.
“Haha @elonmusk is talking abt drugs agai—” Yep,&amp; his words hold a lot of weight. Joking about it minimizes the very real consequences that result: misconceptions, social stigma, shortages.

@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf This guy talking about misinformation being dangerous while spouting off about ivermectin which actually saves lives. Keep getting those jabs bud. Maybe the 10th one will finally work if you make it through the other 9!
@hasanthehun Time for some of that sweet ivermectin
@elonmusk @pmarca Oh, shut up. That's the level of research used by the folks who decided Ivermectin would protect them from COVID.  Keep your dinner party convserations at the dinner party.
@AFletch1984 @SCOOTERX1 @theworkshop36 @MerissaHansen17 Lol, guess what, darling. Facts don’t care about your feelings.  The search yields dozens of articles from around the world about Ivermectin.
@Burton20149220 Moderna Montreal factory will make Canada an mRNA 'leader,' says Trudeau  Why? COVID-19 is harmful only for the elderly/immune compromised, for all else it is like the Flu. What about Ivermectin/ other medicines.  How many mRNA vaccines will make us 1/16th virus?
@CopblockApp @johnpavlovitz @fairyviewroad The New England Journal of Medicine seems pretty conclusive on the matter.  https://t.co/U03wkmFFFk

@MojoRider333 @UCRSAE @cmezian @aperlb @jack @elonmusk Micahs a bot. Thought so. Only a moron would think ivermectin would work after what happened to the Egypt paper in late 2020
@broadcastmike These dudes acting like the sinfulness they claim is in the covid vax isn't in motrin, viagra, and ivermectin, too.

@AmongComrades @POTUS ^this poster smokes ivermectin.
@nofeltweaver @Becstar89 Dr McCulloch gets PAID by antivax groups to promote Ivermectin as a part of COVID treatment, despite the fact it has been clinically shown to be ineffective. 2/2

@GavinNewsom Imagine this horrible scenario. You or someone you love gets Covid, and doesn’t die from Covid, but is killed by the horrible “Hospital covid treatment protocols” and the drug Remdesivir. Stop Newsom’s and Fauci’s hospital death camps.
@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Bwahahaha. Whatever. Ivermectin works and that is a FACT!
MOO MOO   PLEASE DO NOT TAKE IVERMECTIN UNLESS YOU MOO.
@joshtpm Someone ask him about ivermectin. I have a theory the imbecile demon that possessed Trump has switched hosts, but I need more proof.
@PaulDerrington @gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Yeah interesting debate for me as a colleague of my partner swears blind that ivermectin sharply turned her covid around. This in the early days with few other options.
@SCOOTERX1 @theworkshop36 @MerissaHansen17 Ivermectin as a SARS-CoV-2 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Method in Healthcare Workers: A Propensity Score-Matched Retrospective Cohort Study.

@Colemama3 @ebennett74 I've found an easy way to test whether I can trust a doctor or not.  Just ask them what treatment they would prescribe if I caught Covid.  If it excludes any of the known, cheap early treatments (HCQ, Ivermectin), then they're on my 'useless' list.
@Waltika @kelowna123 @Carawieneke @raoult_didier @MdBreathe Agree I’m sure it was multiple factors, but I believe Hydroxychloroquine was one factor
@JudicialWatch @CraigKellyMP  Looks like your vindicated about your views on HCQ and ivermectin..
@ken_keathley I strongly suggest he decline the dangerous drug, remdesivir. Please contact Dr Peter McCullough or Dr Mary Bowden for safe and effective treatments.
@DaisyCousens The SARS-CoV-2 strain of late 2021, Delta, was pretty nasty when I got it. I treated it with ivermectin which, in my non-medical and completely subjective opinion, tested with a sample size of one in a non-double-blinded, non-placebo-controlled, non-clinical trial, worked well.
@UCRSAE @cmezian @aperlb @jack Ivermectin doesn’t have 72 positive studies. It has none
@magamuslim1 @gatfield_matt @borucu_erkin @Mann_Agarwall @kateyhagaman @nyulangone No benefits....but the Hydroxychloroquine patients did end up staying in hospital LONGER.  What a wonder-drug!!!  🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 https://t.co/aaQQ9o0vFY

@jeanette_jpp How many of these studies include zinc? Remind me: how many ivermectin studies have been retracted… and why. Please read and understand this article from the BMJ before spreading further misinformation: https://t.co/mpywnXqZbX https://t.co/gAow1Zp4Fp
@genemapper24 @BrokerJerome @ebennett74 wrong. It wasnt badly needed. We had early treatment that worked. Yes Ivermectin works, so does HCQ. They wanted their gene therapy in every arm for a reason &amp; it has nothing to do with protecting people.
@PaulDerrington @gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Agreed ivermectin worked for me as well.
Ivermectin is a wonder drug.
@piratekidd66 @MdBreathe @GovAbbott Studies that have discounted ivermectin, treat patients too late; typically after they have been hospitalized.  The lion share of hospitals do not have a treatment protocol for infected patients.  Here is one that has been refined with proven results: https://t.co/EF04ASPcKg

@johnmckne Anyone can easily get ivermectin &amp; ivermectin here. Visit:- https://t.co/3FPVMuMSmt
@jeanette_jpp You’re banging the ivermectin drum in light of the overwhelming evidence it doesn’t work for COVID. Do you know how many ivermectin studies have been retracted or don’t you care?
@semisweet4 we are ship OTC &amp; ivermectin worldwide.
Depending on the ethics of the doctor as to whether or not he will prescribe it. I don't need Ivermectin but I asked my doctor if he would prescribe if I did and he said he couldn't, it would be unlawful, it's horse medicine.  I said it is also for people that need it. https://t.co/i5k1vbklST
@MdBreathe @GovAbbott I’m shocked at the replies.  #ivermectin is one of the safest, cheapest drugs to treat #Covid with.  People feel better within hours.

@Enigma_2626 @gatfield_matt @borucu_erkin @Mann_Agarwall @kateyhagaman USA lied about Covid deaths. 100%. Just how they lied about early treatment options. My cousin died from being put on a ventilator. He was 47 and healthy. My other cousin was treated successfully for Covid at @nyulangone with #HydroxyChloroquine.
@magamuslim1 @gatfield_matt @borucu_erkin @Mann_Agarwall @kateyhagaman @nyulangone He went to HOSPITAL  Thats an average hospital stay for covid. Most people who go to hospital with covid don't die  The study from that hospital, *that you quoted*, found no difference to treating with Hydroxychloroquine or not. That's science  You MAGA believe in BS &amp; conspiracy https://t.co/LrlXzQB5rN
@akheriaty How about the other drugs I’m starting doubt them to  Just look at remdesivir
@littleAnn0rphan You should!!  I was born in QC, lived in QC for a few years and this is how Ivermectin Boy (or at least his supporters) want to play? Hopr he loses via landslide.
@pete988007766 @MediaSequitur Yes and still lying and covering up. A friend of mine could not leave the hospital or his wife when she was taken in with covid and other issues. The pressure to allow them to give her Remdesivir was relentless. So much so he would not leave her side. Bring on the tribunals.
@noneyabisnis0 @NyxKillpop You think ivermectin is a covid cure you're clearly dumb as hell it is not recognised as a covid cure dumb fuck
A better way to kill MAGA voters would be to pretend COVID isn’t real; a “democratic hoax” even; sabotage our response; slow roll the production of tests; continue selling millions of tons of PPE to China; push ivermectin and injecting disinfectant while trashing vaccines. https://t.co/8O25Y5MhJT
@OXHarryH1 @DaisyCousens I find it more alarming that debate around potential front line treatments, such as hydroxychloroquin and ivermectin, was censored and politicised, making it all but impossible to run said actual medical trials.
@VB_DPenny @ottobound 2) a cure would cost these pharma companies &amp; researchers billions. Don’t trust these doctors who only prescribe poisons. If these liberal sheep are too lazy to do research, that’s on them. Ivermectin &amp; chloroquine are very useful drugs &amp; cheap. That’s why jabbers all but banned

@Bethmo010170 @MerissaHansen17 The NIH also rejects the idea of using ivermectin to treat against Covid-19.
@truthiscensord @tedlieu Ivermectin? Failed every reputable clinical trial mRNA Vaccines? Incredibly good at preventing serious illness. Kennedy? Grifter, liar, racist and you buy into it. So sad.
@SabinehazanMD This makes so much sense to me specifically with my mom’s case 3 months ago. She started taking a very low dose of IVM but blamed it for her extreme GI issues and discontinued, ending up in hospital on day 18 with 72% O2 and hypoxic. We refused vent and Remdesivir.
@BobbyLGauthier @ken_keathley An irresponsible anti-vax quack who says, "I will not be accepting new patients with routine ENT problems who are vaccinated." She uses ivermectin which works well against nematode parasites but is worthless against Rona.

@JackLaridian @GOP OH NO!! THEY PUTTIN’ THE FENNTUNNEL IN THE IVERMECTIN!!!!
@elonmusk @pmarca Musk isis promoting the same kind of “research” that causes people to die while taking ivermectin instead of accepting effective treatments.
@caroljsroth And the bartender is dr malone, and rogan says, we'll take the usual, Dr malone gives them ivermectin, HCQ, Vitamin D, zinc, NAC, nicotinamide, quercetin, Vitamin C, and Nigella sativa.
@SCOOTERX1 @theworkshop36 @MerissaHansen17 Patent expired on ivermectin decades ago. Anybody can produce it. It's much more profitable for Merck to sell new and expensive(patented) drugs.
@OXHarryH1 @tedlieu Ivermectin is cents a dose. Those who speak out are attacked, ban, censored, threatened with their license to practice. They have NOTHING to gain. Those who push vaccines have everything to gain. They have huge conflicts of interest &amp; are paid to push a narrative, nothing to lose

@VP @KamalaHarris Heard ivermectin is really good for this
Liberals are constantly spreading misinfo about ivermectin. For starters, it is NOT just “horse medication!” It’s an anti-parasitic for many mammals!

@PiperK @elonmusk That’s what uncontrolled free speech gets you: Insanity.  And Ivermectin
@PatriotRob76 Hydroxychloroquine is made from quinine. When taken with zinc quinine forces the zinc into your cells and acts like a Jeffrey's ladder to viruses, bacteria, and other parasites that use your cells for reproduction.

@PoliBard I keep saying this, one minute it was wall to wall news coverage then nothing. By the way, Ivermectin is what happened 😉
@CheriJacobus No, but guaranteed a bunch of folks ditched their prescriptions without consulting their mental health specialists. Shades of Ivermectin.

@MerissaHansen17 Ivermectin for me not for thee....
@glarriuz @jack What killed millions was the administration, CDC, FDA refusing early treatment and the right to try. Denied care, lied about the safety of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. Never has the medical industry as a whole refused access to early treatment, never.
@JackPosobiec Covid is bullshit and ivermectin is an awesome medication .
@truthiscensord @tedlieu DEBATE ME DUDE posting diatribes from discredited doctors selling supplements and getting wealthy working prescription mills. Sure, that's really great.   In the real world, vaccines work and ivermectin does nothing for Covid. https://t.co/ndZi5KZzU2
@VitalikButerin Yes, some of his supporters are now going to feel emboldened to discuss ivermectin or call out big Pharma for their shady shenanigans wo fear of being autobanned.  His detractors may be on enemy ground now, but that's where his supporters have been for the last decade.
@mrs_genoa @PalmerReport Absolutely. When the ivermectin eat horse paste commercials show up I'm out of here.
@elonmusk @pmarca JFC. Now healthcare workers are going to go through another round of psychopaths disputing their advice (see: ivermectin) because of this irresponsible advice from *checks notes* a guy with no idea, but a lot of misguided influence. Seriously. Just go away already.
@martak_oz @PierreKory That’s true enough. The current evidence is that Ivermectin needs to be taken very early and is useless for severe infections. The initial doctor’s appointment would be the time.
@Johnnashearer @solid2gas @DebbieM63123 @CaribbeanBTCho2 @DrLoupis @beatonpar It is primarily a dewormer with very minor off-label uses as an antiviral. No large-scale test has definitely proven ivermectin to be a useful treatment for COVID-19. I won't say it is one until someone actually proves it is.
@TraciDelaney19 @MdBreathe Don’t take either, new research from Brazil says IVM has no effect on Covid-19 in reducing hospital admission https://t.co/JMIvySdvXM IVM is good at ridding lice and worms in sheep and horses though

@ottobound Ivermectin my friend. What do you have to lose at this point? God bless you! ✝️🙏❤️
@GeoffMiami @MrASays The ivermectin did.
@MerissaHansen17 Because they are owned by big pharma.  No money to be made from ivermectin regardless of who owns it.
@Enigma_2626 @gatfield_matt @borucu_erkin @Mann_Agarwall @kateyhagaman @nyulangone You can call @nyulangone and ask about #HydroxyChloroquine   It works. I  personally know doctors who treated covid patients FOR FREE using hydroxychloroquin. U should be in jail.
@elonmusk @MarvinMilton2 @pmarca Was prescribed it when dealing with migraines about 14 years ago. Went to very dark place quickly. Stopped it after 1 week.  Guess what has saved me @elonmusk ?  Ivermectin. Truth.
@leslibless It's true!! If you give this crap to your loved ones you might as well have the funeral arrangements made!!😡😡😡 https://t.co/lRmRGUK75g
@AnnastaciaMP It’s not over. We still have a state of emergency. We still have medical apartheid. We still have second class citizens. We still have no jab no job. Our doctors still can’t treat us with ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. @qldhealth @yvettedath
@phweber1 @drsimonegold @elonmusk W.I.L T. alert. Ph weber countries across the world that used Ivermectin almost irradiated the virus. And I will forgive your ignorance mectin is a prescribed pill. Know what's great? Jan 2023 thr entire liberal narrative gets its comeuppance
@lulubell2141 @MAGAMARIE3 I love that! Where did you get Ivermectin?
@leslibless Where are our law enforcement?!!!  This has been criminal from the start and it continues to get worse!  See studies on Remdesivir when first used in Africa!  Where the fuck is the outrage?!!! Where is law enforcement?

The same week as the ⬆️ @elonmusk tweet, hydroxychloroquine prescriptions increased 2.5x over the normal weekday average.

@GovTimWalz What about the blue collar workers who NEVER skipped a day of work? Why only reward the very people who pushed this further than needed? Hospitals were rewarded with huge payments to treat people the WRONG WAY! Vents were NEVER the answer, Ivermectin and HCQ are!!
@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Speak for yourself, I for 1 do not need to be infantilized by the government.  I'm quite capable of figuring things out for myself, tyvm  Ivermectin works, ask the over 200 members of congress who were treated with it
@elonmusk Joe Rogan is right wing, endorsed Ivermectin, all wrong.....
@MerissaHansen17 They don’t get kickbacks from ivermectin

Let’s try this free-speech thing am I allowed to say ivermectin three times ivermectin ivermectin ivermectin😂😂
@piratekidd66 @MdBreathe @GovAbbott Vaccination is for prevention of infection, and has proved to be ineffective.  Ivermectin is for treatment, and is effective if taken early on the onset of the infection along with zinc &amp; z-pack.   https://t.co/FPTy7QJ1ZE
@PatriotFlip Never had one. Treat with Ivermectin as any symptoms start-even flu

@phweber1 @drsimonegold @elonmusk Oh, honey. You are a victim of Big Pharma’s lies. Ivermectin is on the WHO’s list of essential medicines. Developed by a Nobel Prize winner. Been shown to be effective against Covid. It’s not approved FOR Covid, but Drs should be able to order it “off label,” as with other meds.
@SabinehazanMD The hospital put her on high flow cannula and 2 ER Dr’s said to her (almost like a written script) and us “when you refuse vent and Remdesivir, we will keep you warm until you pass.” The infectious disease dr thankfully tried Acterma as a “hail mary” and it turned her around.
@OXHarryH1 @tedlieu The media censors &amp; hides real data &amp; pushes to the front the propaganda you read. There are countless clinical trials that support Ivermectin. https://t.co/4SVSnKuYbx
@MerissaHansen17 Ivermectin was sold over the counter in Italy,....until Jan. 2020.,....just a coincidence I'm sure..
@RonFilipkowski @americanmclass Legalizing ivermectin and then getting news casters to talk about it seems like a much more humane way than fentanyl. Getting them to drink their own piss might work, too. How about snake venom?
@kelowna123 @BonnieS21912114 @Carawieneke @raoult_didier Yes. Because he shows you the data and explains it. He also has studies stemming from his hospital where he shows - for instance - that the best predictor of the result of studies on the effectiveness of HQL or Ivermectin is the amount of conflict of interests of the scientists.

@MerissaHansen17 Great question, Merissa!!  My wife had a very bad cold, and took Ivermectin for 3 days.  She is much better now!!
@ChildrensHD @US_FDA @CDCgov Nurses have dubbed remdesivir “run-death-is-near” for its high mortality rate. 54% in trials. Faucis pony.
@JoJoFromJerz who gets to take the last ivermectin pill.
@realTuckFrumper Trump killed hundreds of thousands of rural trump supporters with his LIES about Covid 19, masks, bleach, Ivermectin, lies about the vaccines, his ridicule of medicine and doctors.  He did a mass murder,, same in Ukraine.
@Denis_Loubet @PPathole @elonmusk @AOC Not at all.  Russia collusion was a lie.  Hunter laptop was real. Hydroxychloroquine works.  But Twitter suppressed all those stories.
@Humanlty1o1 This is from Feb 5 2020. The drug maker Gilead. The drug Remdesivir. Testing on humans in China. I doubt they had a choice.
@RobbieJee @Eroc2022 @MarshaBlackburn Have you looked at the real data?  Wake up and smell the coffee.  Ivermectin is an anti viral that has been used around the world over 35 years. It is an antiviral for malaria and other viruses safely and very effectively. So think outside the box Martha is right.
@deathxdiscourse but with that first clove it felt like fire through my body   then i puked up a huge network of that green mucus and the bloody flecks were now straight black  ivermectin is anti-parasite and so is garlic  garlic is key to a lot of weird shit
@EricTopol Despite all the lies and obfuscation, nothing comes close to the efficacy of ivermectin.
Funny so is Ivermectin..... https://t.co/AVd2f7TT2c
@leslibless It will murder every child &amp; any Dr that gives a child Remdesivir is a killer
@PierreKory Ivermectin worked a charm for me and my family...clearing it right up

@MysterySolvent @duty2warn He just did to Wellbutrin what the far right has been espousing about Ivermectin.  I don't trust this narc as far as I could throw him.
@RpsAgainstTrump Never was a shortage here never will be. But they can find Ivermectin anywhere I bet 🤷🏻‍♂️
@TomFitton @jack @eb454 @nypost @Twitter @elonmusk Posted about Hydroxychloroquine back in March of 2020… he never got suspended… what’s up with that? @jack Was @TomFitton being targeted as a conservative?
@Waltika @kelowna123 @Carawieneke @raoult_didier Front line doctor in my family never travels without Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine. @MdBreathe has successfully treated 2300 patients w a protocol including Ivermectin, no deaths, no hospital, yet she may lose her medical license 🧵

@MixxDeb I respect and understand that stance. We all draw boundary lines.  I think he made that statement to test the waters by covertly drawing an analogy between Wellbutrin and Ivermectin. Unsourced opinion.  If so, he's the narcissistic, pot-stirring shit I believe him to be.
@PhillyPharmaBoy Do you know what the death rate was on Remdesivir when Fauci chose it for hospital protocols? It was 53%. Why would a drug that is only proven to help if given in the first few days be chosen for a hospital protocol for COVID when it is impossible the person would get it soon?
@RealMiniAOC @elonmusk Lockdowns DID NOT Work! Masks DID NOT Work! Jabs DID NOT Work! Hydroxichloroquine DID WORK! Ivermectin DID WORK! Hunter Bidens Laptop is REAL! Ashley Biden's Diary is REAL! And... Seth Rich WAS the DNC Leaker!  Will the Ministry of Truth have me SILENCED NOW?

@mrpist0ler0 @elonmusk @PPathole @pmarca Im glad you got better. Long COVID is a bitch. Still there's no way to prove your recovery was due to ivermectin or whether the disease ran its course and resolved on its own. Research is research and after studying hundreds of people there was no benefit. More studies will come.
@BrujaAnon @FLCaseyDeSantis @ChristinaPushaw Ivermectin! Check out Dirt Road Discussions on Telegram.
USD5300!!!! That is insane. A course of Ivermectin costs less than 20 bucks. Even if you then buy vitamin D, C and Zinc that will set you back less than USD50. Big pharma is evil incarnate. https://t.co/qpWKxWHkdh
@RonFilipkowski I thought the bleach, ivermectin and hydroxychloriquin would take care of that.
@conspiracyb0t How about the murders of Barry &amp; Honey Sherman, who owned the Ontario lab that created Hydroxychloroquine? Why? HCQ (like Ivermectin) is a cure for virus’s &amp; even cures cancer! They then scare us to get the shots so when we are sick,they sell us more  meds. Worse yet, many died.
@sunithaNair1111 @olgatokariuk Don't forget what happened during covid US stopped supplies of API But russia continued it's supplies to india Russia gave the crucial remdesivir to india So if u say boycott russian goods ur being ungrateful &amp; biting the hands that feed u Ukraine sides with those that hate india

@elonmusk @pmarca &amp; ivermectin?
@warrantonegirl @irritatedwoman @jack @eb454 @nypost They are responsible for thousands of deaths. We followed doctors we could trust, took Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin and stayed far from hospitals and testing.

@SaltyCracker9 Both Covid and AIDS can be treated with Ivermectin! Lol
@nofeltweaver @tonytardio Move on to Ivermetcin. Early trials - unscientific showed hope. After more rigourous amd properly conducted trials found not to be the case. Why - here's even an article today - look at the research if you wish. Pollies exagerating again -  for your vote https://t.co/pGj3qrJIMW
#Covid19 Active patients should be treated immediately to prevent its spread. Following medicines may be taken as per prescription of doctors. #Remdesivir, #Virafin #Tocilizumab,#Baricitinib #Molnupiravir,#Paxlovid  #Favipiravir.
@yvryellen Remdesivir is a cancer nursery - glad to see they’re recommending against it   It’s mechanism to destroy the virus is to disrupt the genetic material which is a dangerous process to kick off
@seanhannity @MarshaBlackburn So, you're against the idea of helping folks get verified info? You think it's fine if some dose themselves with ivermectin, or avoid treatment  entirely b/c they think it will make them sterile or impotent? I think you don't quite get the concept.
@MichelleRehder1 @AshishKJha46 Keep staying stuck in the land of stupid while millions have successfully used ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine along with monoclonal antibodies

@Reuters It's over.  And if it's not, there's nothing you can do about it.  Two years of trying has been a disaster.  @fauci is definitely over.  He can take his millions and go away.  But Tennessee did just make Ivermectin available over the counter!  Smart state! More need to follow.
@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Took Ivermectin and my covid was gone in a day you douche.
@Ron81964605 @rahrah77777 I'm to the point where I think no one should take it.. Ivermectin actually works. So does nasal wash of saline and Povidone iodine (1%). Kills the virus where it replicates. I met Dr Peter McCullough last week and he said he now recommends that 1st!
@truthiscensord @tedlieu The ophthalmologist who couldn't stop selling hydroxychloroquine? Really? That idiot?
@mastertyler94 @CasperVDean @briantylercohen @SalzenBart @elonmusk I looked on the WHO 7.2 and it said there had NEVER been a death from ivermectin! It’s sad because fauci &amp; media started this, knowingly killing people! Please read The Real Anthony Fauci by Robert F Kennedy Jr you’ll be shocked at the corruption!
@MerissaHansen17 Because there is no money in it. Plus it doesn’t have all kinds of side effects like Remdesivir.

@BugoutInWoods @VPrasadMDMPH @DrToddLee That’s also why most experienced people assumed hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, etc., would not actually be helpful.  If Tamiflu is the best we’ve made for influenza over all these years, it would have been quite remarkable for something useful vs. COVID to just be laying around.
@overrunbydogs Musk was the pioneer of Azithromycin and Hydroxychloroquine pushing from the falsified study.  Never listen to this fraud of a man. Musk is an investor, he isn't anything special outside of siphoning money.
@CT_Bergstrom Wonder if he has a take on Ivermectin, windmills causing cancer, and how you sometimes have to flush 10 times.  Power corrupts. Absolute power turns you into a narcissistic sociopath.
@_kbishop It’s just somebody trying to find a way to get elected as a moderate in the upside down that is Arkansas politics… where Mary Bentley’s primary opponent is accusing her of not being far right enough. Mary “Ivermectin” Bentley is too centrist for some?
@elonmusk Trump won and J6 was an insurrection should both be allowed on the platform. Ivermectin works and it’s doesn’t should also be allowed. How will either side be upset if this the case?

@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Ivermectin works against early mild covid cases. Are you going to deny that ivermectin is a protease inhibitor for sars-cov-2? Or that the in silico evidence for its anti-viral properties is identical to that of pfizer's own antiviral covid drug?

@JamesLynchGTC @HealthySaneBE @matt_quantum @cappuccino64 I heard critical care physicians say the decision made to use steroids for covid like dexamethasone saw significant improvements in outcomes of patients. That later SOC was more effective than the former, so it is reasonable to ask what the comparison being made w/ remdesivir was
@RonFilipkowski A drug that focuses on and kills MAGA... and this isn't Ivermectin? He sure?
@PierreKory @Covid19Critical Please can someone show some data on ivermectin working as the new info states it doesn’t work. Dr Karl (Australian scientist) has a big influence on the Australian people and he is loving spreading this info on ivermectin not working.
@KellyMo35360323 @Carawieneke @MDinCanada Remdesivir is a death sentence.
@MerissaHansen17 Because Ivermectin is a generic drug and will not make billions of dollars. If there is a treatment for the virus. The so called vaccines would not get emergency authorization. There are billions of reasons why they want you to get many shots.
The silver lining about the new owner mouthing off about ADHD and anxiety drugs he knows nothing about is he's telling people not to take them.  There won't be a shortage, like last year when my wife couldn't fill hydroxychloroquine.

@DrEliDavid @jomcc2011 I agree. Lots of people lost their lives because they believed MDs and PhDs telling them that Covid was just like the flu or that ivermectin would cure Covid. Fucking horrible to have medical doctors that were complicit in so much death
@randomfurry1234 @EricTopol @NEJM And yet Fauci is on record recognizing ivermectin as a treatment for covid in the 90s.  Weird, huh?
@ottobound START TAKING IVERMECTIN OR FENBENDAZOLE!!!
@Waltika @kelowna123 @Carawieneke @raoult_didier @MdBreathe Death rates in Africa low despite low vax rate. Hydroxychloroquine widely used there for malaria. Men who invented Ivermectin won Nobel prize. It was handed out in India in covid kits. In the US it became political so early treatment denied, some got real sick 🧵
@ken_keathley Because that would help him get better. They intend to kill him with Remdesivir. 🙏🙏🙏
@KellyMo35360323 @Carawieneke @MDinCanada My wife in AZ, after Remdesivir they topped off by giving her bacterial pneumonia with the tubing. There is no outside the box thinking once they're in the hospital. It's CDC protocol killing them with Gilead making a ton of money. Awaiting a class action against Gilead!
@MinThomp Ivermectin cures everything apparently
@Barbie4Trump65 @PatriotRob76 Tonic water has quinine in it. Hydroxychloroquine is made from quinine. Take 100 mg a day of zinc and drink a 2 leter bottle of tonic water.

I am taking Ivermectin and I feel wonderful!  Kick Big Pharma's poison pills to the curb and take the cure God put on this earth instead.
@UndefeatedNevaL @wenter2420 @BethanyCherisse Yes, I started taking ivermectin and I'm feeling much better. Have no idea if the vaccine had anything to do with anything, the pharmacist might have been giving vitamin shots. Placebos can be 60% effective according to some studies. Everyone has a time to go .

@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Apparently you know nothing about ivermectin either, nor it's more than 40 year history in treating parasites in animals and humans as well as its antiviral properties that were known at least as early as 1989 when it was studied as a potential antiviral for HIV.
Dr. Musk is giving out free advice. Step right up. Get your free tube of Ivermectin while you're at it. https://t.co/98T9tTHEFQ
@gcsurf123 @JoseMac110861 @KatTimpf Apparently, TRUTH doesn't matter to you. I would take Ivermectin (on the WHO's list of essential medicines) over the "Vaccine" any day. One is a very safe medicine, used for decades without issue; the other has a long list of adverse reactions, including death. Tough choice.
@Bethmo010170 @MerissaHansen17 https://t.co/2iBaG1fJSN  Yeah you would have to inject an unsafe amount in a humans body to see any effect.   You would potentially overdose on a horse dewormer.
@MerissaHansen17 @CarloGrims If hospitals prescribed ivermectin there would be no plandemic, a death would be very rare, and not many people would take the experimental jab with a quick cheap fix like ivermectin
@lizardhead61 @stxmom @MdBreathe If she’s had patients with Covid get better being treated with ivermectin it’s effective!! How are you this dumb?? Wait- the government told you it doesn’t work so that’s what you believe 🙄 OMG wake up!!

The FDA Just Approved Remdesivir for Infants and Young Children - UncoverDC https://t.co/HA7w2QQi3z
@ebennett74 All I want is for all vaccines to be tested like Fauci wants Ivermectin to be tested.  None of the childhood vaccines have been tested that rigorously.
@US_FDA Why are you giving children Remdesivir? You know it kills. No way you are not liable for this.  WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?
@PhillyPharmaBoy @MerissaHansen17 Tylenol is way more dangerous than ivermectin.  I'm not concerned about people using ivermectin ineffectively or unnecessarily, that happens with other OTC drugs too.  We all know the real reason why it's not OTC.
@cmezian @aperlb @jack Faucci first said dont wear masks. The government said we should shut down for 2 weeks.The FDA said Ivermectin doesn’t work on Covid. Now we know paper masks don’t work, shut down for over a year and Ivermectin has 72 positive outcome studies.If u don’t get it u will never get it
@gcsurf123 @FiddleWeez @KatTimpf Ivermectin works. Fauci is a serial killer   The Biden administration is the most corrupt in our country’s history.

@elonmusk @pmarca So first we have to deal with the bs about ivermectin, proven to be no better than a placebo, from Rogaine.  Now, Elon is dishing out medical advice.  And the far left are the extremists. 🤣🤣🤣

@chedancer @Covid19Critical Paxlovid has drug to drug interaction issues and recent reports showed people who used it got covid again and it didn't help. CNN and NBC reported it.

@JohnStrangerUSA You really don’t need HQ or ivermectin. If you cut the replication in your sinus passages and gargle frequently the first few days, you can stop it as soon as you have symptoms. Dr McCullough has an excellent protocol that helped my unvaccinated family breeze through it.
@psychopoulos @yinzerrob @DanRather Yet both Ivermectin and HCQ do work against Covid, a large number of trials show this. To protect the proftits of Pfizer and others though, that option had to be suppressed. Pity people are so gullible.
@andrewbostom Well they did torture seniors to death in ICU isolation, then quietly reported the c19 death to collect their blood money, not to mention the Remdesivir kickback..
@leslibless This doesn't give me confidence in the FDA. The class action lawsuit against Remdesivir may actually take a drug company down.
@jack Must have missed the Hunter laptop, vaccine, mask mandate bs retractions. The regeneron, ivermectin retractions ..
There is no climat crisis. Covid vaccine is poisonous. Biden is remote controlled. Ivermectin is the real thing to cure that man made virus. How is Tedros still walking on our streets?

@LoofboroDan @GoblinKush420 @thebradfordfile Except that that science isn’t on the side of Ivermectin, so your use of quotations around the word science is definitely accurate in your last part of the comment.
@ViperX83 @MsBlaireWhite @libsoftiktok Wait your a nurse? For how long a month? You know what off label is. You know all meds have more than one use. Did you go to clown school? Look up the actions of ivermectin. I'm a nurse and confused how your being so dumb.

@PaulDerrington @gcsurf123 @KatTimpf I know multiple people who used ivermectin and definitely had Covid. Fine in 48 hours.

@SarahVsypen @cara__noel And thanks to all the nut jobs taking ivermectin, HEARTWORMS are developing resistance to the med. dogs now need to be on interceptor or the pro heart shot. I think the process is about 1 k over the counter. The shots are about 500 and the meds are steroids and antibiotics

@Honeybee_musing @MsBlaireWhite @libsoftiktok No, not all meds have more than one use, though many do. Moreover, when meds do have more than one use it is because they have been shown safe and effective for the new indication. There have been no clinical trials with ivermectin demonstrating efficacy against cancer.
@auntbat12 @HereForItYall @Adolwulf @redsheri1 @jack And trusting big pharma when they've had multiple life ending blunders is as equally naive. Remdesivir has literally killed people while Ivermectin has been working wonders. Yet which is approved and which isn't? Africa is doing great with Iver and they actually use it for a lot
@Cherylscotian1 @freedumfghtr @msTKinTO Can I ask how you got your hands on Ivermectin?
@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Ivermectin, the human medication, was studied. It was not a bad outcome. Did not really show benefit or harm. Digest that however you want. But Russia does not get censored, nor does terrorist, just conservatives. If you agree with that, you are part of the problem
@DearAuntCrabby With a side of ivermectin, like ranch.
@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf You really do drink the kool-aid. Ivermectin actually works. Living proof. More people I know that got the jab got covid than those that didn't get the jab. I recommend doing some research before calling what you don't understand misinformation.

@AntonioTweets2 I SUPPOSEDLY  was sick..tested positive took ivermectin  got better and their stupid test still said positive 3 weeks later, that same day took another test..Negative...I was fine the whole time, I had a fever for about 7 hrs, kinda high so I went to the dr..Dr...🙄
@mizdefiant I lost my wife from the Fauci bio weapon and insane CDC and hospital protocol and was locked out of hospital for 22 days before I could see her. By the time I was let in, Remdesivir had destroyed her kidneys and the hospital had given her bacterial pneumonia from the tubing.
Everybody check this out and KEEP SHARING. Fake Dr.Fauci is damn  Liar! Ivermectin was approved a long time ago. Everyone should be pissed off. Ivermectin is a wander drug. It actually CURES,  They don't want us to know about cures, because they want customers, not cures. https://t.co/KuuPsiFbFq
@TheTorontoSun Should have had Ivermectin!!
@ViperX83 @MsBlaireWhite @libsoftiktok How about this... as a nurse you know for a fact meds are used for more than one reason.  Ivermectin shows good anti inflammation actions by reducing the bodys reaction to the infection which means can reduce fluid in the lungs.  https://t.co/0eKN9Picgd

@MR_F_B61_12 @KurtSchlichter Freedom to say that Ivermectin is safe &amp; effective.  Freedom to say that Covid-19 was created in a lab. Freedom to say Hunter Biden's laptop is NOT "Russian disinformation" Want me to continue? There are plenty more.
@leslibless OMG!! But still won’t give us #Ivermectin .  It’s all about the 💰
Got Covid Nov. ‘20. Tested +. Had to ask Dr. for his preferred treatment (Ohio regulation). Took hydroxychloroquine/Z-PAC/Zink Sulphate cocktail. Fever broke in 12 hrs. Felt normal after 5 days.  How many people did Dems kill by calling this ineffective and dangerous.
@ITGuy1959 @Ronnie4Trump My husband, son, daughter-in-law, and myself - none of which are either vaxed OR "boosted" - all had covid at the same time and we experienced mild symptoms as well - because we were all TREATED with monoclonals and Ivermectin.
@VetNationPod @terrymbs2 @D415Y_CU773R @KamVTV All of these are still conspiracy theories. You can't find the truth if you are still listening to idiots like Alex Jones and Joe Rogan.

@gcsurf123 @JamesWi71803834 @PaulDerrington @KatTimpf Because ivermectin is a VIRAL Suppressant. Whike pneumonia Is most often caused by a BACTERIAL infection. rendering the treatment useless. However, true COVID-19 is viral.

@CrowMagnumMan3 @RepMTG 0 if your referring to ivermectin. Ivermectin got the Nobel prize and has been prescribed millions of times. sometimes Advil is prescribed to dogs does that make it dog medicine. Look into hundreds of members of Congress and celebrities used ivermectin to treat COVID.

@CryptoSparkler @elonmusk @PPathole @pmarca I took ivermectin during a very bad case of COVID and I was over it in 3 days with only 2 doses. No long COVID either.
Follow up to last year's WHO trial in Uttar Pradesh (240m pop.) During Jan wave:   -34% fully vaxd at start -16,000 cases a day peak -21 deaths a day peak -mask use decline by 25%  Surely is a strong case for #Ivermectin

@1100mph1 @BenjaminJobe3 @Redpilled9 Ivermectin has approx zero therapeutic value and perhaps some mild prophylactic value - if taken at high doses continuously.

@starland_sound I do not recall Pfizer ever running a study on ivermectin. Please provide a link.
@gregkellyusa She thinks ivermectin is a horse deworming. She probably needs dewormed. She knows how to change Joe's diaper. Let's go Brandon.

@bootsndiamonds @WHCommsDir This doesn’t help nearly enough, but the FDA did amend the EUA for Remdesivir to anyone over 28 days who is at high risk.
@katwatkins2011 @ReneDrew7 @RepBrianBabin @RepChipRoy Probably died from the ventilator or drugs that shut their organs down.. they had safe drugs like ivermectin that would have saved many but wouldn’t use it because big pharma had to make money  I’m not wrong on anything I’ve said

remdesivir as the official treatment in a hospital, but they have not done this or many other acts of overreach.  The executive branch [CDC/NIH] is forbidden to coerce/manipulate hospitals to use of remdesivir. Therefore they are now usurping [stealing] power.   Same for the FDA.
Let's check out the new Twitter   Ivermectin works and is safe.  The RNA vaccines don't work and are dangerous.  We are living in medical tyranny and Fauci is evil.  The election was stolen and O-Biden is illegitimate.  Crooks and traitors rule is now.

@theworkshop36 @MerissaHansen17 You do know Merck still sells ivermectin under the name Stromectal. The company that makes Soolantra is also publicly traded.

@missy_lynnk @AOC @elonmusk Key words: “lupus patients I know”   Speaking from experience is fine and all but just so you’re aware, hydroxychloroquine is first line treatment for most, &amp; that’s been the case for decades.

@jer006 @TheDailySledge @KoonceStephen @ksorbs Again overblown stories of claims of some kind of miracle drug. That’s not what happened…and yes some doctors were prescribing it. No they were not prescribing horse dewormer. https://t.co/5ehd2w4paq
@Honeybee_musing @MsBlaireWhite @libsoftiktok You gave me a link to the Weinstein brothers yacking with each other. If you think ivermectin is actually useful in COVID-19, please show me what you think is the single best study you've read demonstrating that.   Because the good studies I've read show that it's useless.
Yep. This is how it works &amp; how it has the entire time.   The wealthy, prominent, &amp; well-connected had no problem getting prescribed ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, standard order pneumonia treatments, things like steroids…  While everyone else was left to die… 😢 https://t.co/QFKrSK1Y7B
@MikkiRWright1 @elonmusk See, you are spreading misinformation. You do realize, Rogan has money and can afford to get human ivermectin?
@SanPen1 @elonmusk @WholeMarsBlog Cool, so the same thing for ivermectin, natural immunity, and choosing to not wear masks applies to that same principle. This is free speech
They should start putting Ivermectin in water, instead of fluoride. I think this is an awesome idea!
Paxlovid is US$530 per treatment and Ivermectin is US$50 at the most. https://t.co/bJyTssCsTr
@elonmusk @pmarca What’s your thoughts on ivermectin!????
@jack I call Bullshit. Everything fact checked censored against the COVID Scam caused many preventable deaths remember HCQ and Ivermectin. Twitter is complicent in the murder of many under this attack on humanity. People should jailed
@elonmusk @PPathole @pmarca Although keeping in mind that conversations you hear around the table are no substitute for cold hard research. This is how ivermectin was touted as a miracle for COVID because people thought they could predict its effectiveness without any proper trials. WB + AD have their uses.
@TC_Woods @MerissaHansen17 Deplorables : Bwaaa Bwaaaa   We don't wan't to get vaccinated  Also deplorables : Yeah, that dangerous Ivermectin is the shit. We gotta get some

@Myworldagain1 @PaulCroftII @scrowder @elonmusk Your whole tweet is misinformation. Covid has a 99.9% survival rate(sounds like we will be just fine), ivermectin is a noble winning med for humans, he never said to drink bleach. Plus freedom of speech also allows you to freely listen to both sides and make a choice for yourself
@phweber1 @drsimonegold @elonmusk This makes you seem uneducated. I’m not sure if you are misinformed or just ignorant. Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are sold over-the-counter or are easy to get in almost every country other than the United States. https://t.co/EMxlZ9753P
@US_FDA We all know snake venom is in remdesivir! https://t.co/TQ47w0AHSL
@melissajonesTO Remdesivir is very risky on the kidneys, do some research on it. Hospitals getting major kick backs to push this on patients. I took it last year and was fine but it’s lead to kidney damage in thousands of people. opt for monoclonal antibodies or paxlovid.
@msTKinTO Bullshit, non jabbed are not being prioritized, nor do they need it.  Your post is hateful rhetoric.  I was just at a pharmacy today, the Pfizer antiviral is available to all, start asking why ivermectin also an antiviral is not available to all.
@Honeybee_musing @MsBlaireWhite @libsoftiktok That ivermectin won a Nobel Prize as an anti-parasitic is irrelevant to whether it cures COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, not a parasite. There is a difference. Jeezuz.
In combination with the bioweapon he funded, Dr. Fauci’s lockdowns and other public health decisions (like lying about Ivermectin) make him the greatest serial killer of all time. More than Hitler!

@Mamalioness7 @chedancer @PierreKory 3515 people  Ivermectin doesn't work against COVID-19.
Still can’t believe that 5 months ago today, I lost my mom due to Covid Protocols and Remdesivir. Someday some lawyer will step up and take on this case and I will bring in a few close friends in on it too. Until then, I will do all I can to let people know to be aware of this😭

@Wakcedout @MerissaHansen17 Ivermectin shouldnt be used to prevent / treat COVID-19 disease,The TGA strongly discourages self medication/ self-dosing with Ivermectin for COVID-19 as it may be dangerous to your health. There is insufficient evidence to validate the use of Ivermectin in patients with COVID-19
@Jeffkaplan17 @phweber1 @drsimonegold @elonmusk So yes, you keep believing what they tell you and keep not looking at research for yourself. It's what they want and you are a perfect sheep to accept that. I wonder why there's such low rates of infection and death in areas where Ivermectin is used for River Blindness...
@RonFilipkowski If he wanted to kill MAGA voters he would have said that they should follow Trumps medical advice.  Ivermectin instead of vaccine.  With a bleach chaser to get rid of those nasty robots that can control your mind.
@mollylambert Ivermectin Pussy
@tammyjmcbride @John28500101 When you go from ivermectin to Hunter Biden and his laptop (a private citizen) and the Steele Dossier ( which actually had some truth in it) you are without a doubt radicalized. I bet you think the 2020 election was stolen, and tRump is a good president. Laughable all of it.
@dankellyvo @terrorhawk0752 @Jasonthehusker @TheDemocrats They didn’t take that approach at all. Say what you want about ivermectin and hydoxy… but at least those doctors where trying something and if you look at the risk of prescribed levels it’s not that great. It was a time to try everything not shut down and dismiss.
How many of the 1,000,000 who died of COVID-19 were deprived of cure consisting of:  1. HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE* 2. ZITHROMAX  3. ZINC  *Banned by FDA early in the pandemic .. CRIME !!

@jack You are so full of shit. If what you said was true, Twatter would not have shadow banned conservatives,  banned Trump, and would have stopped shutting down accounts tweeting about Hunters laptop, hydroxychloroquine, face masks, etc long ago.
Like Hunter Biden’s laptop is Russian propaganda?  Ivermectin is only a horse dewormer?  Maybe 2 weeks to stop the spread and masks work?🤣🤪😜😆😝. Okay, little Goebbels; trust the official narrative! 🤣🤪😝 https://t.co/neY1f8LoPI
Hey, NH! – Tennessee Just Passed a Law Allowing the Dispensing of Ivermectin Without a Prescription https://t.co/TsEGGBLHdX #shopPetersSquare
@MerissaHansen17 Because a medical professional needs to be involved to determine the nature of the medical problem and then prescribe the appropriate treatment. In the case of ivermectin, a diagnosis of scabies or strongyloidiasis (unusual in the US) would warrant its use.

@AdThomz @Deborah41670304 @drsimonegold @elonmusk @JohnStrangerUSA You mean those that said that Covid-19 may have been engineered, that Hydroxy Chloroquine and Ivermectin are effective early treatments for Covid.

@ELeighDL @HamHealthSci @fordnation @celliottability The studies were purposely thrown. They gave ivermectin too many days after onset of virus.

@jack No a-hole you are not going to get easy A. Your banning of doctors w/valuable life SAVING info on IVERMECTIN  and Hydroxycloroquine literally KILLED MILLIONS around the globe. People took vaxx and you banned info on DEATHS from it. You made sure SENILE JOE got installed into WH

@pmarca They’re so dishonest. I got prescribed Ivermectin many years ago - way before COVID - after an overseas trip gone bad and was surprised at how it got dragged through the mud as horse cream. Not saying anyone should take it for COVID but it’s also not just a horse cream to mock.

@DoucetCheryl @ClayTravis 1/The top doctors that pushed for ozone therapy, ivermectin, early treatment, or any other treatment outside of remdesivir and/or vent were either fired, lost their med license to practice, ostracized, or unalived. Look up ozone therapy and learn. C19 is a bioweapon.

@MerissaHansen17 Ivermectin is used to treat against parasites.   Covid-19 is a virus.  The company has already issued a statement that ivermectin doesn’t work against Covid-19 because it’s a virus not a parasite.   Politicians promoting ivermectin probably bought stock in ivermectin.
I’m on a regimen of ivermectin as a prophylactic me and my family have never praise God contracted any of this crazy stuff created in the Wuhan laboratories https://t.co/mcdnhs96iK
@GarmanDuane @scrowder @joerogan @elonmusk He literally had a guy on who said Ivermectin was going to make covid extinct. He had another guy on that said covid wouldn't spread if you were asymptomatic. Both of those things are false information.
@WendyRogersAZ Ivermectin is used to treat against parasites.   Covid-19 is a virus.  The company has already issued a statement that ivermectin doesn’t work against Covid-19 because it’s a virus not a parasite.
According to BioSpace serious side effects from remdesivir affect a quarter of patients negatively. They report, “About 25% of patients receiving it have severe side effects, including multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome, septic shock, acute kidney injury, and low blood pressure.
@DWUhlfelderLaw Please look into why he allowed 1 million Covid tests to expire, what happened to the 1 million doses of Hydroxychloroquine he purchased, and the $300 million Florida retirement fund he refused to divest from Russia? Thank you.

@MysterySolvent “Does ivermectin cure stupid”
@elonmusk Twitter locked my account for posting an excerpt from The Japanese Journal of Antibiotics on Ivermectin, for "violating the policy on spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19". https://t.co/eOCyNKwZAA
@MSteeze23 @Jeffkaplan17 @phweber1 @drsimonegold @elonmusk When clearing parasites, ivermectin is taken for one day at a dosage up to 200 mcg/kg ONCE. It is taken ONCE. Tell me how a drug taken ONCE prevents COVID-19 forever.
@glarriuz @jack Do you really think Trump did not take Covid seriously?  He did emergency action to get a vaccine created. He wanted multiple fronts addressing the virus, such as HQC or Ivermectin. He wanted businesses to create ventilators. Chinese are who unleashed the virus on the world.
@PhillyPharmaBoy @Jeffkaplan17 @phweber1 @drsimonegold @elonmusk And I never said it worked for life.... You did.... I was just asking a question that several studies are asking as well. Why are rates so much lower in Africa where we see much higher rates of use of Ivermectin And other Anti-parasitic drugs? There's a correlation thats it.
@martak_oz @PierreKory It’s important that people wait until the full information on Ivermectin efficacy is reviewed. It’s particularly important that only Ivermectin approved for human use is made available. https://t.co/XIS6gX3NOl
Let me save you the trouble… it doesn’t work!  Ivermectin works! It works better and it’s safer!  OMG… the utterly transparent effort to prop up this drug so they can fleece taxpayers.   U.S. seeks “urgent” data on COVID relapses after using Pfizer drug  https://t.co/Jf3CqhuBZe

@Honeybee_musing @MsBlaireWhite @libsoftiktok That's not the whole reason they say not to use ivermectin, it's not any reason. The reason not to use ivermectin is because it doesn't work.   I asked you this in response to another comment you made, but what is it that you think off-label means?
@Med_Ingenuity @MdBreathe Thank you for following up with him  At least no one mentioned #HCQ or #Ivermectin …then he’d REALLY be upset
@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf 3 of us had covid, took the pill for ivermectin and worked just fine
@babs_zone @AOC @elonmusk China treated almost all of their covid cases with it during the early waves. It works. So does ivermectin, just ask all the American politicians that used it while telling us plebs that we couldn't have access to it. You are surprisingly susceptible to propaganda.

Reason…the patent has expired on ivermectin and anyone can make it. Oddly enough…remdesiver was the only hospital authorized treatment🤔
@TheCJWolfpack @scrowder @joerogan @elonmusk Ivermectin was never used the way it was recommended by the doctors on Rogans podcast so of course it “didn’t work”.  Asymptomatic lack of spreading was also stated by the CDC.
@stxmom @MdBreathe Ivermectin isn’t safe or effective for COVID. You must be a quack.
@Honeybee_musing @MsBlaireWhite @libsoftiktok Except that we've studied ivermectin for COVID, and found that it doesn't work.
My friend died because the hospital didn’t give her ivermectin &amp; hydroxychloroquin when she requested it! She requested monoclonal antibodies &amp; was told only the severe cases get that! They kept her on Remdesivir while her oxygen levels dropped! 🤬
@gcsurf123 @JamesWi71803834 @PaulDerrington @KatTimpf Publications at the bottom show 2 studies that ivermectin helped?
@gcsurf123 @Jeminai1 @PaulDerrington @KatTimpf Ivermectin is dirt cheap. The other drugs not so much.
@PoliBard In some states, the Government handed out health kits which included Ivermectin. Cases and hospitalisations plummeted immediately
ICYMI The science link https://t.co/or56zH6VdT   As mentioned above, the broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug Ivermectin , which is widely used in the field of parasitic control, has many advantages that suggest that it is worth developing as a potential new anticancer drug
@Honeybee_musing @MsBlaireWhite @libsoftiktok Ivermectin is not effective in treating or preventing COVID.
This Misinformation crap began w/the COVID health crisis when Trump said hydroxychloroquine might work &amp; the media FREAKED. Then they SEGUED into using misinformation B.S. w/Hunter's laptop being Russian Disinformation. Now their using is to shutdown Free Speech Do we need a MGB?

@msannierose @PierreKory How do you know Ivermectin brought your low O2 back? Everyone I’ve known who had Covid and reduced O2 levels took nothing and they came back on their own.
@NEJM Hey go ahead, believe what you want, but i know people who are alive today because the got on ivermectin within the first 3 to 5 days, and i also know a few who died following the CDC protocol and were killed by that failed Ebola med Remdesivir.
@PaulDerrington @gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Ivermectin saved my life. But the media made fun of anyone who dared to use the drug because the media companies are sponsored by Pfizer.   I don't expect weak-minded gullible sheep like the guy tweeting above to understand that.

@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Ivermectin and hydrachlorquin worked for everyone I know and many more. It was used in nursing homes, hospitals, primary docs and ERs prescribed it. Worked great. To say "it has 0 benefits in treating Covid" shows how much you truly know. We against popular opinion and the CDC..
@PierreKory Must be a lot of people out there that need to be dewormed!! Ivermectin doesn’t have any efficacy towards Covid which has been proven though scientific studies - but don’t let this pesky little fact get in the way of your stupidity and ignorance!!

@jack either overtly or tacitly you are complicit in gross crimes over the last 5 years. in fact the suppression of workable therapeutics like Ivermectin (which I and countless others i know used successfully) cost the lives of 100s of thousands of people. Own THAT!
This guy is always shilling for ivermectin, Vitamin D, whatever quackery he can find, to make up some absurd statistical analysis.

@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Btw, ivermectin won the Nobel prize and has helped millions of people in the world.  But you in your weak State of mind baught into the horse dewormer narrative.
@hiebinator @MeghanMcCain What if I told you my cousin was really, really , really sick with covid .Started taking ivermectin , it went away in 4 days ..that's a fact not misinformation. So if that's a fact, why will you people not accept it ?
@PierreKory Ivermectin should be taken by unvaccinated Trumpers when they get COVID. I highly recommend it.
@acidropOSY Have you tried the new ivermectin-flavored Moxie? It cures everything from roundworms to being alive.
@HenryParsons77 @AConcernedPare2 Agreed.  Remember, with kids it's milder.  Zinc, Vitamin C, Vitamin D.  Lots of fluids.  Saline nasal rinse, then gargle with mouth wash - that will help kill what is in nostrils.  Do you have ivermectin?
@PierreKory Why would I take that when I can take hydroxychloroquine, and I can make hydroxychloroquine at home. Here is the question who makes ivermectin.
Ivermectin is now available without a prescription in Tennessee https://t.co/pybhQ0U78z
@AGIowa Why isn't Ivermectin available to anyone not just those on ventilators or critical?  Taken early it can prevent going critical.
@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Ivermectin works.  The disinformation on that came from our own government.  Research it.
@nilhumanum @EnergyVampire10 @MondaiMann @lordisthisfree @LozzaFox @SadiqKhan @Jacklouisfox @emiliafox check out Martin and Mondai. These dimwit incel sheep bleating antivaxx lies fed to them by Piers Corbyn and Mike ‘insane’ Yeadon are all the rancid Lozza is left with. Bottom of the barrel clowns drunk on Ivermectin who spew bile in all directions.
@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Damn I was agreeing with you up until you mentioned ivermectin...you far left sons of guns are hard to spot online, until you say something retarded. You may as well said you like being taxed as much as possible 🤭.
@wiczipedia Can you make a song about how Hunter Biden's laptop is real, Ivermectin works, and Russiagate was a hoax?
@PierreKory I fear lots of people on Warfarin could get seriously ill or die if they go out an buy Ivermectin OTC without the understanding that it is contraindicated with use Warfarin. It's extraordinarily dangerous to take the two at the same time and most people don't know that.

@glarriuz @jack Whitmer and cuomo killed Americans. Oh yeah and the vaccine. Imagine how many lives would have been saved if they were treated with ivermectin? Oh yeah you don't want to have that covo. Get back in line for your booster. The trash is now taking itself out.
@WGNNews Get some horse paste ivermectin. All symptoms were gone in 28 hours after just two doses. used myself as a experiment and i was blown away.   it hit my heart that there was treatment all along and so many suffered and died so big pharma and politician stock holders could get rich
@BeenHavingIt66 @KellyMo35360323 @Carawieneke @MDinCanada My friend worked at a hospital, got Covid in April 2020.  She sounded so doped it was scary. I called the hospital and told them I’m going to be checking in on her daily.  This is before they go so brazen. Remdesivir was not used on her, but obviously Midazolam was.
@LarryBlaze6 I suspect she was set up. I'm only blaming her for not thoroughly vetting him before giving him the platform and fame. She honestly failed to do due diligence.   Question, do you recall a really crappy study about Ivermectin and Covid? Let me see if I can find a link😊
So you can't post a comparison video of "ivermectin vs paxlovid structure".  Twitter won't allow it... Ping @elonmusk.  So Google the quotes and you will get a YouTube video by Dr John Campbell.  Are we being scammed again... https://t.co/Ltakld5PGj
@GOPLeader Ivermectin and Scrubbing Bubbles doesn't count 🤭
@aliasfool @Corey69387462 @gcsurf123 @KatTimpf That’s their fing choice man. Ivermectin didn’t kill them and even if Ivm info wasn’t out there they’d prob still not get vaccine. So it’s mute point
@KirstieMAllsopp Yes, I have heard this..a lot! Why would you get a booster if you already had it? Bulk up your immune system. Zinc, D3, Vit C, Elderberry... FYI Quercetin is Natures Hydroxychloroquine and Wormwood is Natures Ivermectin.
@WiseHelen21 They are killing them! This &amp; Remdesivir. Both are known, knowns!
@JoeTalkShow @nypost Can't talk about Ivermectin without being shut down.
@DeathMetalV Pass the Ivermectin, please.
@BretWeinstein Right!  Like now we can REALLY talk about how awesome ivermectin is and how totally ineffective and corrupt the Coronavirus vaccines are!  You’re now a cautionary tale of how an otherwise intelligent person can be corrupted by conspiracy theories.

@BeenHavingIt66 @KellyMo35360323 @Carawieneke @MDinCanada I think my friend got a cocktail of drugs which included Hydroxychloroquine, because she was released in 4 days.  They told her they were going to put her on a ventilator, and she refused and got up and walked around. I think this is pre-meditated, if you get my drift! CRIMINAL!!

@NeilAxelrod @GIGIx3_MAGA @ottobound I don't know if ivermectin or juice or vitamins could help.  But if/when I've been told that that's it for me, I will try anything that even had a rumour of success.  You can roll over and go to your makers with all your skepticism. At least I'll have tried.  No harm no foul.
@swarr22 I think i have the basic tools to understand that the vaccine did not prevent you from getting #Delta  #Omicron . I got omnicron took ivermectin .  Have asthma knocked it out in 3 days  no hospital , no booster every 90 days  im good
@Jim_Jordan They are busy currently testing ivermectin.
@snobiwan @eroticacid I'm feeling like we're missing a key strategy by not making better use of ivermectin as some kind of bait/reward.

@NeilAxelrod @GIGIx3_MAGA @ottobound Are you a researcher? NIH shows lots of studies for ivermectin usefulness for various cancers. Its very common to re-purpose drugs except for covid because the Pharma gatekeepers then lose billions if there are cheap effective meds already available.
@CTVNews Ivermectin works  HCQ works  You just lie about everything
@NeilAxelrod @GIGIx3_MAGA @ottobound Look it up you'll be shocked. Lots of studies saying that ivermectin, and the substitute for ivermectin it's a different substance I can't remember the name, both showing positive results.
@MeghanMcCain Your party believes eating bleach and ivermectin cure covid. You believe pizzagate. You idolize InfoWars. You  believe crazy conspiracy theory shit. Someone has to protect the children from you &amp; your ilk.
@thankgodthatso1 It never was! It's the Ivermectin Insurrection part DUH!
@EMdocinabox @nashland11 @OscarCollazo123 @NEJM So give us some data on the "willy nilly" ivermectin prescription?

@BaxterPeterba @PierreKory My trust in certain studies is very low. Some are sloppy at best, shonky at worst. Academia hijacked.

@BJ19791 @silverflyt @DefySolipsis @SinsLikeABoss @NEJM "You can also overdose on ivermectin, which can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypotension (low blood pressure), allergic reactions (itching and hives), dizziness, ataxia (problems with balance), seizures, coma and even death."
@Kellywtp @s_berca @marie2015nope @malolisica @flindall_steve Or ivermectin
That doesn’t help under age 5… so, how many parents/close contacts vaxxed?   How many vaxxed w/Covid &amp; flu?   How many parents/close contacts had Covid?   How many treated w/Remdesivir/or oral anti vitals?   What instrument used for chemistries? Reagent?

@PierreKory @martak_oz I was thinking about why a state might allow the purchase of human doses of a drug that is useless against Coronavirus. Perhaps because people taking the horse deworming version of ivermectin are killing themselves on overdose?
@PhillyPharmaBoy @kirsten_klang @GIGIx3_MAGA @ottobound Exactly.  “But my neighbor’s boyfriend’s cousin’s boss said he heard on Joe Rohan that Ivermectin could cure cancer.”  Here are is a search result with a bunch of tenuous Chinese articles and zero validated proof, but if you don’t believe me, you’re as bad as Fauci!

@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Ivermectin? Are you stupid. That shit actually works unlike these bs vaccines
8. After a year &amp; half of studying Remdesivir the WHO now recommends it for early outpatient treatment only; which is the only way it should have ever been used. Hundreds of thousands of Americans died needlessly because Fauci could not be questioned.
@KellyMo35360323 @BeenHavingIt66 @Carawieneke @MDinCanada Evil to the core! Fauci is invested in Remdesivir…. And he’s behind the EUA. I’ve been shouting this stuff from the rooftops for over 18 months.  All censored. I hope Twitter will be different now, as this censoring is resulting in more death, and that’s a fact!
@ianisinterested @TomiLahren @elonmusk No, it refers to false things that are (sometimes cleverly) promoted as being true, in order to achieve some effect.  Eg. claiming that Hydroxychloroquine was effective treatment for COVID was a form of disinformation by people who wanted to present an alternative to vaccines.
@rn_critcare If they go into shock, hook them up to IV Ivermectin instead.
@Velasco2013 @vlad1011 @DrPeepstein @tyler Who knows. I've been following covid since like late december/Nov 2019. And saw many doctors telling people to ask your Dr for ivermectin. But then suddenly those videos disappeared. And all this horse shit came up.
@rhonda_harbison @GOPChairwoman Two years of a pandemic.The country still Has to deal with the unmasked unvaccinated patriots.

@CollignonPeter ...and what IF early treatments had been offered to the elderly?...eg Vit D, Ivermectin HCQ etc  ...how many lives saved?
@djhdcj @Publicwrongs One of the words on the filter list is "ivermectin". Should a public health website host advocacy for an alleged Covid treatment for which there is no evidence and which could be medically harmful? Would that be responsible?
Sen. Klobuchar's bill would have given Alex Azar or Tom Price the authority to, for example, issue guidance terming reporting on the spread of COVID itself (or the ineffectiveness of Ivermectin) disinformation and punished platforms. No thanks.
@nrvnews @sophieafloat Ventilator's and the real killer drug, remdesivir.....in ebola trials killed 53% within 10 days and was withdrawn from the trial as unsafe.....now its the only covid approved drug....yes hospitals are now genocide establishments.
@gcsurf123 @KatTimpf Ivermectin is a great disinformation example, problem is this is for doctors and scientists to examine this. Ivermectin is a very great human medicine and through lies and manipulation people have come to believe it’s somehow dangerous or meant only for animals.

@theRealDrewR @greenSketchbook @abiroberts BTW, the vax-me-a-dozen-times crowd loves to attack Ivermectin because it’s used on animals (regardless of the fact it was developed for humans) as a dewormer. I’m not judging its effectiveness on Covid, but you can’t claim good b/c animals use it, and then bad for the same.
@ShaytanTruth @FatEmperor Not forgetting criminally fraudulent trials into HCQ a cheap, life-saving antiviral.  To gain an Emergency Use Authorisation for the profiteering no liability jabs they had to destroy the reputation of HCQ.  Trials sponsored by vax profiteer Gates: https://t.co/ZXtQs1VITK

@GoblinKush420 @thebradfordfile The scientists who have studied Ivermectin and its effects on COVID in a clinical setting. Also, the reason vaccine efficacy is waning, is because not enough people have been vaccinated and it is allowing the virus to mutate.

Ok…I’m really not trying to start anything by asking this…but what is so wrong w/docs prescribing Ivermectin? They prescribe all kinds of drugs for off label use all of the time. I admit that I haven’t done much research about it I am just confused.

@midwestmantooth @DanBarreiroKFAN @KFANRosen It's been around for about 15 minutes and developed by one of the most corrupt organizations on planet Earth. And since ivermectin is having great results there's no point in another experiment for Dan. The first one clearly already failed.

@jonhinson @TallPhilosopher @TechTedLasso @deanpirtle1 @waitbutwhy @SwipeWright I bet you believed Hunter Biden's Laptop was Russian disinformation, Covid vaccines stopped transmission/infection/hospitalization/death &amp; Ivermectin is only a horse dewormer. You should try on a hat, they improve critical thinking.
You know what does numbers? 2 ignorant shitstains making fun of a child on a farm losing her fave calf to parasites bc they ate the ivermectin it needed, bc they thought it cured covid. Try again. https://t.co/zjpChMuos6

@PBGuy71 @JamesMelville Do some research on the approved hospital protocols. They only approved the use of Fauci’s Remdesivir which is clinically proven to cause organ failure. The virus wasn’t killing people, the hospital treatments were.
@LizzieSuspended I was hospitalized 6 days in October with "covid" it was probably influenza.  The hospital gave me intravenous remdesivir 3days. I told them I didn't want it. Causes liver and kidney failure. They stopped it. I got better and was released on the 6th day.
Sorry if I appeared  flippant regarding Ivermectin treatment. Cancer has affected  Us all and it is so prevalent. Five from my family in last 4 years.C-19 + vacx has created a hugh distrust of med field.  GOD BLESS ALL that are in this battle.
@1100mph1 @AshDSpencer @Redpilled9 Thats complicated to unpack also. If covid doesn't do well outside in sunny climates... if Ivermectin has shown to be at least somewhat effective as a prophylactic... but both of those at least at one point were against the narritive. Is Ivermectin still dangerous horse dewormer?
@beilis_jay Remdesivir is what I was referring to. It's an antiviral approved for covid treatment. But it has to be started early. I really hope you have a mild case. https://t.co/1EZWkS2DY2
@NeilAxelrod @GIGIx3_MAGA @ottobound Do your research before you tell someone something doesn’t work. Ivermectin has been found to cure some cancers. Try it @ottobound. My friend did and is now cancer free. Prayers for an army of angels to surround you.
@gcsurf123 @PaulDerrington @KatTimpf What if it is shown that the information against ivermectin was disinformation spread by pharmaceuticals that wanted to get paid?  Calling it "horse dewormer" was a purposeful language slight aimed and misinforming the public that it has no human use.
@CharlesLCarter3 @strxwmxn Why did they try ivermectin?  It worked in vitro.  Should I repeat it?  It worked in vitro.

@kirsten_klang @NeilAxelrod @GIGIx3_MAGA @ottobound There is not a single clinical trial cited. Thousands of agents are active in vitro or in mice that are devoid of anticancer activity in humans. Should ivermectin be tested for anti-cancer therapeutic activity in human trials? Probably. But no such data currently exist.
@baonao10671 @uNaCcEpTaB63 Show me the RCTs of these treatments and then we can debate. Oh, wait ivermectin was found to do diddly squat. Next time, come dressed for the game. This is anecdotal opinion. In other words, shit data. Published, peer review clinical trials. Come to the table prepared.

@gcsurf123 @PaulDerrington @KatTimpf I would argue otherwise. For every study that shows it didn’t help, there are just as many that say it did. Working in a school, exposed daily, and on a dose of preventative ivermectin. Only person in the family or school that has not had Covid. I’m sure it is just a coincidence.
@MickeyMarch1 @putin_smells @katrax123 @nilikm @melissajonesTO The individual making the claim needs to back it up. Please provide one citation showing that ivermectin cured cancer in a clinical trial. I have not seen the data.
@RBReich Yeah, check with Joe Biden about that.  He shadow banned HQC and ivermectin while paying big pharma to produce “new” drugs.  One of which is almost identical to ivermectin.
@BeenHavingIt66 @Indiagirl99 @Carawieneke @MDinCanada Thank God you knew what Remdesivir was. Most were locked out and just told they were starting the protocol.  My husband was murdered 15 months ago.  I put my trust in the hospital we had always used

@CharlesLCarter3 @strxwmxn Hospitals do this all the time.  Especially when dealing with something like covid they have no known treatment for.  That's why there were SO MANY early studies from various hospitals that tried, among many other things, ivermectin with mixed (not all negative) results.
@GrizzlyRiverArt @nashland11 @OscarCollazo123 @NEJM That being said, until the data was clearer I didn't really hate on docs providing ivermectin. It was ridiculous but whatever.  Now that it's clear, its bad medicine. Most of these docs are also prescribing hydroxychloroquine which has been disproven a dozen times over.
@aviddaisy @TulsiGabbard Cool.    Windmills cause cancer, inject bleach to cure covid, the vaccine has microchips, JFK jr is coming back, all the elites are pedophiles, Q is god and so is trump, he never paid stormy daniels, ivermectin is great, election was stolen, antifa is responsible for Jan 6

Things most Americans have no idea about because the MSM propaganda machine likes it that way 1) Jesus followers are NOT terrorists 2) Ray Epps 3) Ivermectin is safer and more effective than vaccines 4) Hunter Biden’s laptop is actually real and matters to national security
9. That science wasn't settled either. And all of these short, incomplete studies about ivermectin that some people are touting mean nothing - there are actually more studies recommending it but you aren't suppose to know that. Americans are too lazy to read medical journals.
@PBGuy71 @JamesMelville Why did the government stop doctors from prescribing medications that worked?  Why was ivermectin demonized when it has been proven to be effective against viruses?
Whenever the govt, any govt, wants to stop disinformation, it just means they want to stop people from knowing the truth.  Like you know, vote fraud also know as "no widespread vote fraud"  or ivermectin, or "the wall doesn't work"  or "biden caused inflation".
Great talk by @camwolfe on therapy in COVID-19 lung transplant.  Beb &gt; Molnupirivir for outpatient.  Inpatient- routine guidance but may need longer remdesivir.  Concern for IA in these.  G-CSF May worsen outcomes.  May need alternate approaches for patients with prolong shedding https://t.co/EijW7SPgyn
Ivermectin is an awesome anti viral I’ve watched it take numerous people through Covid safely
This is the drug that cause kidney and liver failure at scale among people on ventilators being treated for COVID. It does nothing to cure covid. It's another Fauci creation that doesn't work just like AZT killed AIDS patients. https://t.co/gieVOsnhLB
@Wiltster @joshmcgoo @PierreKory Youre a engineer right? Hopefully you'll get this. Randomized control trial that controlled bias showed no benefit and previous studies had multiple flawed methods.  I've used ivermectin for years internationally, it's rarely prescribed in the US cuz we don't need it. Clean water
Ivermectin Now Easily Available in Tennessee https://t.co/0nxRjBpvMY
@MeghanMcCain Ivermectin, anyone?  Trump won the election, anyone?  JAN 6 was a peaceful demonstration anyone? Now that's some scary sh*t
Kory: Ivermectin works. Everything else is a conspiracy, repurposed drugs etc. I BELIEVE ivermectin works! I KNOW it works!  Science: The data unequivocally show ivermectin is not efficacious for COVID-19.  Kory: you’re brainwashed!
Effect of Early Treatment w/ Ivermectin among Patients w/ Covid-19  Treatment w/ IVM did NOT result in lower incidence of medical admission to hospital due to progression of C19 or of prolonged ED observation among outpatients w/ an early diagnosis of C19  https://t.co/ura9L0TBgO
@KariLake @iansmithfitness Check out this article from azcentral:  Arizona governor candidate Kari Lake is now also a witch doctor and witch hunter  https://t.co/veZYUvvm1B
@dezmondOliver @SanPen1 @elonmusk @WholeMarsBlog Probably banned the same way HCQ and ivermectin were. And govts solution was to shut it all down instead of funding studies because any successful early treatment would end the EUA and the 💉wasn’t approved outside of that so it’s all about the 💰for big pharma.
@RebeccaLChris Ivermectin as others have said. Glad I have supply for all my family and friends. Everyone has gotten better quickly with it.
@FireyTopaz They did a study that came out...early this week or L8 last week that found Ivermectin did absolutely no good against covid...i retweeted it
My source is  Google ( Big Sis info) But ivermectin cures some cancers And it's also made for dogs.its just flat out interesting.
Pierre Kory on record again refusing to accept the data. Why let data get in the way of a zealous crusade for #ivermectin  https://t.co/TNf4WbwMrF
@Jeminai1 @PaulDerrington @KatTimpf I’m sorry are you saying ivermectin isn’t also itself produced by the pharmaceutical industry?😍
@Charles04144986 remdesivir is a nucleotide analog antiviral, not a live attenuated virus
@lazybotliz @sparrowinvests @KevinKileyCA Don’t forget about Remdesivir shutting down Covid patients kidneys, etc and Ivermectin wasn’t allowed.
@rn_critcare Their blood is probably full of  bleach and Ivermectin anyway.
@FlashCapades24 @BretWeinstein @elonmusk He pished  ivermectin a lot. Try to know something before you speak
@AntonioTweets2 I took small doses of Ivermectin going into the hospital for ankle surgery; came out with a head cold (5 days).  Love my immune system and my new ankle.
Captain Ivermectin!!!!!
@2picklesinabun @PierreKory Not everyone is even aware the FLCCC has a website and not everyone knows about Ivermectin through the FLCCC and what don't you understand about "over the counter?"
Japan drops vax rollout, goes to Ivermectin, ENDS COVID almost overnight -sources.
@ottobound Buy some Ivermectin and activated charcoal asap
@joe09_LA Hi joe it me! Thanks for the ivermectin 💪
@profamirattaran Craziest theory going around right now is that #Remdesivir, #COVID19 #vaccines &amp; drinking water are actually snake venom that will "make you a hybrid of Satan"  Somehow this has hit a large audience, so sites have had to fact check it 🤯  https://t.co/ZSvKtyQ8G4
@PierreKory Says the Medical Policy and Management guy.  lol  If Ivermectin works for COVID, get it approved via clinical trials like everybody else. Where do they get these clowns?  It's a good thing that they don't tout Hydroxychloroquine and bleach or something anymore at least.
@nickmmark Really? Still shilling I see. My husband has two co-morbidities. I have two also. Diabetes, high BP, autoimmune disease, obesity, age. We both started ivermectin on Day1, prescribed by Push Health. We followed with Fluvoxamine and a steroid. We had flu-like symptoms for a week.
@gcsurf123 @LauraWi82813817 @PaulDerrington @KatTimpf If a doctor recommends something else they are an expert.  If a doctor recommends ivermectin, their expertise is null?

@jack Twitter is largely responsible for every disastrous policy enacted by the Biden administration.   You helped to arm the Taliban with the finest military grade equipment.  You helped with record breaking inflation.  Every death from banning ivermectin is also your fault.
@MartyMakary Maybe she’s really sick. I think she needs remdesivir
Rep. Susan Lynn, R-TN ; Ivermectin "this historically safe medication that works well with viruses." https://t.co/6VvE5Kl0I7
@PoliBard Ivermectin ( for 1/4 billion in Uttar Pradesh at least)
7. which occurs in the first 3 to 7 days. After that comes a major cytokine storm &amp; massive inflammation which Remdesivir was never intended to combat, that is why the WHO recommended AGAINST using it, yet the US government made it the standard of care for hospitalized patients.
@DianaWilliams61 @wham0la @EricTopol @NEJM That was doctors that actually did preliminary studies and spoke about their patients and 100% success yet the federal government refused to listen to what they were saying and not just those two doctors doctors all over the world who use ivermectin successfully were ignored.
@RonFilipkowski Was he using ivermectin? His father should have just hurled tomatoes 🍅 at them.
@B_Dogood @bhweingarten Additional misinformation from your brainwashers Hunter Biden laptop Russian disinformation Trump told ppl to drink bleach Trump called Nazis fine ppl Trump cleared Lafayette Park for a photo op ivermectin only for animals Ivermectin/HCQ are unsafe no mandates will happen Etc.

@GunderTheCovers @UnknownBans4425 @sandro_pozzi @elonmusk Did people drink disinfectant after Trump claimed it might help with Covid? Did people die because they thought hydroxychloroquine in fish products would cure Covid. There are a lot of gullible people.
@camay1351 @NeilAxelrod @GIGIx3_MAGA @ottobound Please site a single human clinical trial showing that ivermectin cures cancer. I am willing to be proved wrong.
@tatereeves How about following in TN footsteps and allowing Ivermectin over the counter.
@US_FDA Positive test, mild symptoms. I took ivermectin. No progression, ok in 3 days.  Meanwhile, remdesivir killed my sister.
@DeKalbCoHD Except the covid shot is not a vaccine. You had to change the definition of the word vaccine to accommodate a mrna gene therapy shot. A vaccinated coworker gave me covid. He was wrecked for "2 weeks". 2 doses of ivermectin "horse paste" ended all my symptoms in "28 hours", no vax
@CPUGenius11 @KATUNews He’s gutting democracy, denied easy access to vaccines/tests, banned books like nazi Germany, removed thousands of voters from roles or changed their affiliation, pushed ivermectin as a covid cure, removed mask mandates from schools-but his kids are safe due to private schooling
@msTKinTO @AnneofKingston Brutal! Funny how anti-vax aren’t refusing it screaming about how Paxlovid is still a “trial” and “hasn’t been proven!” And to twist the knife even more, some are probably laughing at the fact that they get it first. JFC, give them the Ivermectin if that’s what they want.
Go to NIH site (https://t.co/vqnkzsU046) and type "ivermectin and cancer"   and BOOM!!! 👇🏼  https://t.co/2TMyyji7xM
@PremierScottMoe India did not use mrna due to the liability waiver required. They used things like ivermectin. Seems to have worked well for them. Good market for us but they really don't like our current dictatorial govt.
@glarriuz @jack They were right! Nothing to fear from Covid all you needed was the treatment. It’s called Ivermectin. Not only would it prevent you from contracting Covid but if you did catch it it would cure it! What killed was the doctors doing to you what the CDC and the FDA told them to do!
@LynnParkPDog @CTVNews mRNA for cancer 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Causing it perhaps. 300% increase since the 💉  Do you realize they’ve been using ivermectin in not only cancer studies but also AIDS studies. Hydroxychloroquine for cancer too…..🤔  Check for yourself.   https://t.co/Pmb9B4sLMZ
@blakandblack I may suggested to Mark Latham that he should follow his own advice re Ivermectin and Bleach.
@byobbioiv @LindaVellis0422 How great to live in TN first state with otc ivermectin! Have you seen it in pharmacies yet? Can you beautiful TNans please start sending it to the rest of the US?
@jack please tell us why were people suspended for just repeating the info on election, covid, ivermectin HCQ …those are important things!  What about the Biden crime family? Is usa compromised? Is this BHOs third term? We are not going to have a country…it will be 2 late https://t.co/maleslLDgW

@missy_lynnk @AOC @elonmusk Glad you haven’t been impacted! At the very least 825000 lupus patients— just lupus, not sarcoidosis or RA or any number of other diseases who use hydroxychloroquine— had to either ration or go without just in the first few months of covid, and issues continue for many.
