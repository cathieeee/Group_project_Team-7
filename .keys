create_TA2C_from_file
Reads provided file and returns a Dictionary with keys.

For this to work plug-and-play, you need to have a file called ".keys"
in your "current directory" --- barring technicalities, keep it in the 
same directory (and run your code from this directory).

> touch .keys
> echo "key=<yprDGNKkvvrQRi5xbPMAMx5Vr>" > .keys
> echo "secret=<CzYpWybW11MidEPy1LPLhsRqDXM529OHOl3U9HxbFXK4sYPxLJ>" >> .keys
> echo "token=<AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANEdbAEAAAAAwCqU0FBz7vSooTAFlYtMchqmfig%3DMpXnTpJSWYgDpoVdNj3OG4i4PGrYjCkmOoitEmrxC4rtqVb9Ay>" >> .keys
 --------------------------------------------------
filename :: name of file to read from
defaults to .keys in current directory
